Consider a large software platform, like a cloud service or a video editing suite. Its long-term success depends on a single critical factor: maintainability - the ability to modify, update, and fix it with minimal effort, cost, and risk.

A highly maintainable system is like a well-organised workshop: any tool is easy to find, and adding a new one is simple. A system with poor maintainability is a tangled pile of cables, making every change a high-stakes gamble you wish you could avoid.

The key to ease of upkeep is the **Single Source of Truth** principle. Instead of duplicating code, you define a component - e.g., a class, method, or constant - in one place and reuse it everywhere. Change it once, and the update propagates across the entire system instantly.

In short, maintainability is about building for change. It's the difference between creating a fragile monument that crumbles at the first edit and creating a resilient, living system that evolves effortlessly with your needs.
