##### What are Decision Trees?

A decision tree is a classic tool for mapping choices - a flowchart that starts with a single question and branches into possible outcomes. For decades, it has been the go-to theoretical solution for capturing processes. But in practice, it fails for one fundamental reason: exponential complexity.

Adding just a few real-world variables - user roles, error states, environmental conditions - causes the branches to explode. Ten yes/no questions can generate over a thousand paths. For anything resembling real operational knowledge, decision trees become monstrous, un-auditable, and utterly unmaintainable.

This isn't a minor inconvenience; it's the fundamental bottleneck that has prevented us from properly documenting complex expertise. The ability to conquer this complexity would open up a powerful new way to build, maintain, and leverage knowledge in any field. {{el.docsAssemblerName}} started as a response to this challenge.
