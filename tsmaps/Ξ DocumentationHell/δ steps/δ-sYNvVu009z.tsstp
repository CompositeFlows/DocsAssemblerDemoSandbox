Text is built from reusable content parts. If you change a part, it updates everywhere. 

There is no lock‑in - it publishes to plain Markdown files, so you can uninstall {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}} and continue working with your files as before.

This website is a guide built with {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}}. The 'Vertical Kitchen Garden Planner' below, is a component embedded within it to give an idea of the complexity these guides can manage.
