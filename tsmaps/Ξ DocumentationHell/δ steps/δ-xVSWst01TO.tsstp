### The Problem with Traditional Manuals

Most organisations rely on traditional manuals, PDFs, and wikis, yet these static resources cannot capture the branching logic of expert troubleshooting or the situational nuances users face. This gap forces companies to rely on expensive, person-to-person training, creating a fragile system that hinges on a few key people. The result is an organisation perpetually one retirement away from a crisis: a true documentation hell where essential knowledge is unrecorded, scattered, and ultimately unusable when it matters most.
