### Step Variables

The list below shows the "step variables" that have been captured as you made choices in this guide.

Think of them as live data points. When you selected an option like "**Balcony**" or "**Lettuce**," the guide automatically recorded it in a variable (e.g., `location = balcony`).

This creates a structured record of the user's path. In a real application, this data could be passed to your code to generate a custom quote, populate an order form, or trigger any other automated process.
