## Garden

A private garden offers the ideal foundation for a high-yield vertical farming system, with ample space for expansion and natural light.

To fully leverage your garden's potential, we begin with a complimentary aerial and topographic drone survey. This provides a data-driven blueprint to design a perfectly integrated and resilient food production ecosystem.

The survey will analyze:
*   **Sunlight & Shadow Mapping:** Creating a full-season model of light patterns to position towers for maximum photosynthetic yield.
*   **Topography & Drainage:** Modeling the land's contours to ensure optimal water management and prevent pooling.
*   **Zoning & Workflow:** Planning the layout for efficient harvesting, maintenance paths, and aesthetic harmony with your outdoor space.

This comprehensive analysis allows us to design a system where your **{{tm.precisionHeatTM}}** root zones and irrigation schedules are perfectly calibrated to your specific climate. If your system requires off-grid power, the data will also determine the optimal size and placement for a **{{tm.hotCarrierTM}}** solar array.
