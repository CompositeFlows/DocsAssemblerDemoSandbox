##### Culinary & Agricultural Profile

###### 1. Flavour and Form
Azolla has a mild, neutral, slightly grassy flavour and a soft, delicate texture. Its tiny, overlapping leaves form a dense, vibrant green mat on the water's surface, creating a beautiful and functional living carpet.

###### 2. The Ultimate Garden Partner
Its main role is as a sustainable nutrient source.
- **Living Fertilizer:** Regularly harvest portions of the mat and add them directly to the growth media of other plants, such as those in the TuberTower or FruitForge, where it decomposes and releases a gentle, plant-available form of nitrogen.
- **Aquatic Filter:** The dense mat helps purify water by absorbing excess nutrients, improving the environment for fish and shrimp in integrated systems.
- **Edible Use:** While not a primary food source due to its small size, it can be blended into green smoothies for a nutrient boost.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The fern forms a continuous, self-renewing mat on the water's surface. Harvesting is as simple as skimming a portion with a net. A single {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}} mat provides a **continuous yield of 30–50g of fresh biomass daily**, perfect for feeding the rest of your balcony farm.
