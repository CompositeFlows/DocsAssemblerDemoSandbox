##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
It offers a mild, sweet, and subtly earthy flavour, often compared to a cross between spinach and watercress. Its magic lies in its texture: the hollow stems (petioles) remain incredibly crisp and succulent when cooked, while the leaves wilt into tenderness. This cultivar produces an abundance of tender stems with minimal fibre.

###### 2. The Stir-Fry Sovereign
This green is the star of the wok, but its uses are wonderfully diverse.
- **The Classic Stir-Fry:** The most famous preparation is *Pad Pak Bung Fai Daeng* (flash-fried water spinach with chili and garlic). Its hollow stems literally "drink" up the savoury sauce, creating an unforgettable texture and flavour in every bite.
- **Soups & Curries:** Adds a refreshing, crisp element to brothy soups like *Sinigang* and coconut-based curries, where it softens slightly but retains a pleasant bite.
- **Fresh & Blanched:** Young leaves and stems can be used fresh in salads or quickly blanched and dressed with sesame oil and soy for a simple, elegant side dish.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant grows vigorously, producing long, vining stems. Harvesting is a ‘cut-and-come-again’ process; snipping the main stem -2 inches from the base encourages the growth of multiple new side shoots. A single {{tm.hydraPadTM}} provides a **continuous yield of 150–200g of prime stems and leaves per week.**
