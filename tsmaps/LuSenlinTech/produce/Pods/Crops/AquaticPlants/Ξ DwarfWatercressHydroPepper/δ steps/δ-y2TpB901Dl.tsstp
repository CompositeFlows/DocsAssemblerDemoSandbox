##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is made possible by contemporary research and selective breeding:
- Unlike its semi-aquatic ancestor, ‘Hydro-Pepper’ is a true hydrophyte, possessing specialized air channels (aerenchyma) that allow it to be fully submerged without rot, absorbing all necessary nutrients directly from the water.
- The intense peppery flavour comes from high concentrations of gluconasturtiin, a glucosinolate that converts to the sharp phenethyl isothiocyanate when the leaves are damaged (chewed or cut) - a potent, natural defence mechanism that we experience as flavour.
- By growing it in a controlled aquatic system, we eliminate the risk of contamination from the parasite *Fasciola hepatica* (liver fluke), a concern sometimes associated with wild-harvested watercress from open streams.

In short, **Dwarf Watercress ‘Hydro-Pepper’** is a **bio-optimized aquatic green** that delivers a consistently intense, clean, and safe peppery flavour, bringing the essence of a freshwater spring directly to your urban kitchen.
