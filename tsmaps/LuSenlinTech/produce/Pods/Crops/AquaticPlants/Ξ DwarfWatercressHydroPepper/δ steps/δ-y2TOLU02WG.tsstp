##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form

‘Hydro-Pepper’ is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and crisp, succulent stems. Its flavour is a clean, sharp, and intense pepperiness, without the slight minerality sometimes found in soil-grown cress. This makes it an exceptionally versatile and potent garnish or salad component.

###### 2. A Culinary Chameleon

This watercress is a foundational ingredient for adding a fresh, pungent spark to a wide array of dishes.
- **Classic Pairings:** The quintessential base for peppery salads, a vibrant garnish for cold soups (like vichyssoise or gazpacho), and the perfect sharp counterpoint in sandwiches and wraps.
- **Modern Applications:** Its intense flavour stands up well to blending into potent green sauces and pestos, providing a peppery backbone without the need for garlic or chili.
- **Global Cuisine:** A staple in European garnishes, it also fits seamlessly into Southeast Asian dishes like *Pho* and *Laksa*, where its clean pepperiness complements aromatic broths.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield

The plant is designed for a ‘cut-and-come-again’ harvest. Snipping the stems just above a leaf node encourages bushy regrowth, providing a **continuous yield of 20–30g of pristine, ready-to-eat greens per week** from a single {{tm.hydraPadTM}}.
