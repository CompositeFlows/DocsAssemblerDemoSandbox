##### The Science & Story Behind It

This blend is a product of advanced biomimicry and food science:
- Duckweed and watermeal have been consumed for centuries in parts of Southeast Asia (e.g., *khai-nam* in Thailand). This hybrid leverages the best traits of both: the rapid growth of *Lemna* and the higher protein content of *Wolffia*.
- It is a "complete protein," containing all nine essential amino acids in a ratio that rivals animal-based proteins like whey or eggs, making it exceptionally valuable for plant-based diets.
- Its astounding growth rate and nutritional profile have attracted significant research from NASA for use in Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS) to recycle astronaut wastewater and produce food on long-duration space missions.

In short, the **Duckweed Protein Blend** is a **living protein factory** that transforms light and water into one of the most sustainable and versatile protein sources on the planet.
