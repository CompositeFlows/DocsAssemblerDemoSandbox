##### The Science & Story Behind It

Spirulina is a testament to ancient nutrition and modern science:
- It is believed to have been a food source for the Aztecs in Lake Texcoco (now Mexico City), who harvested and sun-dried it into cakes called "tecuitlatl."
- It is one of the few food sources of the antioxidant phycocyanin, the pigment that gives it its brilliant blue colour, which has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.
- NASA and the European Space Agency have extensively researched Spirulina for its potential use in long-term space missions due to its incredible nutritional efficiency - it produces more protein per unit area than any other food source.

In short, **Spirulina Mat ‘BlueCore’** is a **primordial nutrient concentrate**, offering a direct link to the ancient power of photosynthesis in its most potent and usable form.
