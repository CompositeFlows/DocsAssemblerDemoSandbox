##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar connects you to a thousand-year-old culinary history:
- Nori cultivation dates back to 8th century Japan, but its life cycle was a mystery until the mid-20th century when British phycologist Kathleen Drew-Baker discovered it alternated between a leafy phase (the nori we eat) and a microscopic, shell-boring phase. Her research saved Japan's nori industry, and a monument to her stands in Kumamoto, Japan.
- The unique umami flavour comes from a high concentration of free amino acids, like glutamate, and nucleotides, which are released when the seaweed is toasted or rehydrated.
- It is incredibly nutrient-dense, being one of the best plant-based sources of iodine, essential for thyroid function, and also rich in taurine, an amino acid important for cardiovascular health.

In short, **Red Macro-Algae ‘Sachi-Nori’** is a **cultured piece of culinary history**, delivering the pure, authentic taste of the sea and the profound umami that has defined a cuisine for centuries.
