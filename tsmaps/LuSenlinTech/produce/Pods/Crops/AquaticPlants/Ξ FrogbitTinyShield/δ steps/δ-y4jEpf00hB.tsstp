##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
The leaves and petioles (stem stalks) offer an exceptionally clean, crisp, and mildly sweet flavour with subtle cucumber-like notes. The texture is its standout feature - a satisfying, airy crunch similar to iceberg lettuce, but more delicate. The entire plant, from its tiny roots to its perfect round leaves, is edible.

###### 2. A Delicate Garnish & Crunchy Accent
Its primary role is to add visual elegance and a light, fresh crunch.
- **The Ultimate Floating Garnish:** An exquisite, edible garnish for cold soups, particularly gazpacho and vichyssoise, where it floats artistically. It also adds a beautiful touch to seafood dishes, cocktails, and summer salads.
- **Salad & Taco Topper:** Provides a unique, crunchy texture in mixed green salads or as a fresh, unexpected topping for fish tacos and ceviche.
- **Quick-Pickled Delicacy:** The stems and leaves can be lightly quick-pickled in rice vinegar, enhancing their crunch and adding a sweet-and-sour note that complements rich dishes like pork or duck.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant reproduces rapidly by sending out runners, forming a dense mat on the water's surface. Harvesting is as simple as skimming the desired quantity of individual plants from the surface. A single {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}} mat provides a **continuous, abundant yield of 30–50g of pristine, ready-to-eat foliage daily.**
