##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a masterpiece of culinary bio-engineering:
- The incredible umami of kombu comes from its exceptionally high concentration of glutamic acid, the same amino acid in MSG. In 1908, Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda first identified this "fifth taste" (umami) after isolating it from kombu, leading to the invention of monosodium glutamate.
- The characteristic white powder on its surface is mannitol, a natural sugar alcohol that forms as the kelp dries, contributing to its complex sweet-savoury profile.
- Wild kombu can grow to over 20 meters in length. ‘Baby Kombu’ is a patented micro-cultivar developed through selective breeding to express its full flavour potential at a fraction of the size, making it ideal for controlled-environment agriculture.

In short, **Micro-Kelp ‘Baby Kombu’** is a **concentrated umami engine**, a living piece of culinary history that allows you to harness the deep, savoury soul of the ocean to transform your cooking from the very first simmer.
