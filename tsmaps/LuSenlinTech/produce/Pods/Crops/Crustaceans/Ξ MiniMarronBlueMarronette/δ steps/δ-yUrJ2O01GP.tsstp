###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Blue Marronette’ offers the quintessential marron flavor: exceptionally sweet and clean with a firm, succulent texture and subtle nutty undertones. The meat is pearly white with a pink blush when cooked, and the tail contains a substantial portion of high-quality meat. The live animal is a breathtaking cobalt blue that transforms to a brilliant coral-red when cooked, creating a dramatic visual transformation.

**2. The Premium Single-Serve Crustacean**
This marron's superior flavor and stunning appearance make it ideal for gourmet preparations where visual presentation matters.
- **Grilled with Garlic Butter:** The premier preparation - split lengthwise and grilled with garlic herb butter, allowing the sweet meat to absorb the flavors while developing a slight smokiness.
- **Marron Thermidor:** A luxurious preparation where the tail meat is mixed with a creamy, brandy-infused sauce and baked back in the shell.
- **Chilled with Citrus Aioli:** Cooked and served chilled with a bright citrus aioli, allowing the natural sweetness to shine.
- **Marron Sashimi:** Ultra-fresh tail meat can be served as sashimi, showcasing its pristine quality and delicate flavor without cooking.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Blue Marronette’ grows steadily in well-oxygenated, clean water systems with ample hiding places. While slightly slower-growing than some crayfish, its superior meat quality justifies the extended cycle. In a specialized Marron-Pod system, a cohort provides a **premium yield of 6-10 harvest-sized individuals per 50-liter unit, reaching optimal size of 14 cm in 20-24 weeks from juvenile stage.**
