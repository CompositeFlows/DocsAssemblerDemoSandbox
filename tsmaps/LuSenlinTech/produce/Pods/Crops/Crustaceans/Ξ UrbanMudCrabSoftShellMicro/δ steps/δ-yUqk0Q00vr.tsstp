‘Soft-Shell Micro’ is a specialized, fast-molting strain of mangrove crab (*Scylla serrata*) engineered for the continuous harvest of soft-shell crabs in urban aquaculture systems. This cultivar undergoes more frequent, synchronized molting cycles than wild crabs, producing individuals at the perfect 6-8 cm carapace size for whole consumption. During the brief window after molting, before the new shell hardens, ‘Soft-Shell Micro’ offers the unique culinary experience of an entirely edible crab with delicate, sweet flesh and a crisp, ethereal texture when fried.
