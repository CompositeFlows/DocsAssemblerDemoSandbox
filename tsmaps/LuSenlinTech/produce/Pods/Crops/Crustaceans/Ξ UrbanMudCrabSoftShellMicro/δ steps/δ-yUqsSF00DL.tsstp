###### The Science & Story Behind It

The innovation of ‘Soft-Shell Micro’ lies in its controlled molting biology and synchronized development.
- The accelerated, synchronized molting cycle is achieved through selective breeding for crabs with regulated ecdysone (molting hormone) production and sensitivity, creating predictable harvest windows.
- The ideal small size at maturity is a result of selecting for early sexual maturation combined with controlled growth, ensuring crabs reach the perfect soft-shell size before their growth rate slows.
- The exceptional sweetness and texture are enhanced by careful dietary management during the pre-molt period, optimizing the crab's energy reserves and ensuring the new shell forms at the perfect thickness for eating.

In short, **Urban Mud Crab ‘Soft-Shell Micro’** is a **molting-synchronized, texture-unique, and harvest-optimized** cultivar, a specialized crustacean that transforms the challenging biology of molting into a reliable production system for one of seafood's most prized delicacies.
