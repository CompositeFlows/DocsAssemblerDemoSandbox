‘Pearl-King’ is a fast-growing, brilliantly marked strain of Giant River Prawn (*Macrobrachium rosenbergii*) selected for its compact growth profile and exceptional flavor in recirculating systems. This cultivar reaches a premium plate size of 25-35 grams in a fraction of the time required by its wild counterparts, developing the characteristic blue-tinged, pearl-white shell and long, striking blue claws of the species. ‘Pearl-King’ delivers the sweet, rich, and slightly nutty flavor of its larger relatives, with a firm, succulent texture that stands up to high-heat cooking, making it the crown jewel of balcony crustacean cultivation.
