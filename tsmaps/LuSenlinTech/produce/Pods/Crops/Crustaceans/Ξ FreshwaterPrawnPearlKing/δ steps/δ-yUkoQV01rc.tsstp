###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Pearl-King’ stems from its accelerated maturation and selected behavioral traits for communal rearing.
- The rapid growth to a specific, moderate size is achieved by selecting for a truncated molt cycle and efficient protein conversion, directing energy into muscle development rather than indefinite growth.
- The reduced aggression and cannibalism are critical traits for high-density culture, achieved by selecting for individuals with lower territoriality and a higher threshold for triggering dominance behaviors.
- The brilliant, pearlescent shell coloration is linked to a robust exoskeleton formation, which reduces mortality during the vulnerable molting period and ensures a higher survival rate to harvest.

In short, **Freshwater Prawn ‘Pearl-King’** is a **fast-maturing, flavor-rich, and behaviorally refined** cultivar, a regal crustacean engineered to bring the luxury of freshwater prawn cultivation to the urban aquaculturist's doorstep.
