###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Giant Prawn Jr.’ offers the identical flavor profile to its full-sized counterpart: an intensely sweet, rich taste with clean briny notes and a firm, meaty texture that holds up to various cooking methods. The meat is opaque white with the same distinctive pink blush after cooking. The prawns display perfect miniature proportions, with robust claws and a deep-bodied form that provides excellent meat yield despite their reduced size.

**2. The Perfectly Portioned Premium Prawn**
This prawn's combination of premium flavor and ideal individual size makes it exceptionally versatile for both simple and complex preparations.
- **Grilled in Shell:** The preferred method - grilling whole preserves moisture and allows the shell to impart maximum flavor, creating the perfect single-serving presentation.
- **Prawn Cocktail:** Chilled and served with classic cocktail sauce, where their sweet flesh and attractive size make them superior to standard shrimp.
- **Stir-fries and Curries:** Their robust texture stands up to high-heat cooking and spicy sauces without becoming tough or rubbery.
- **Tempura and Frying:** The uniform size ensures even cooking in batters, resulting in consistently crisp, golden results.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Giant Prawn Jr.’ exhibits the same rapid growth characteristics as standard strains but reaches harvest maturity significantly earlier due to its determinate size. In a recirculating AquaPod system, a cohort provides a **high-density yield of 25-35 premium prawns per 40-liter pod, reaching the target half-size of 13 cm in just 8-10 weeks from post-larval stage - approximately 30% faster than full-sized strains.**
