###### The Science & Story Behind It

The precision of ‘Pocket-Lob’ represents a breakthrough in crustacean growth control and flavor development.
- The determinate growth stopping at exactly 40-50 grams is achieved through selective breeding for a specific myostatin-like gene expression that halts muscle development at this optimal size, creating unprecedented portion control.
- The rich, oceanic flavor profile is enhanced by supplementing the diet with specific marine-sourced algae and selecting for individuals that efficiently convert these compounds into the signature lobster taste compounds.
- The vibrant color transformation from blue to red is more dramatic than in most freshwater species, achieved by stabilizing genes for astaxanthin retention and the protein complexes that create the color change upon cooking.

In short, **Nano Lobster ‘Pocket-Lob’** is a **size-precise, flavor-intensive, and luxury-optimized** cultivar, a genetic masterpiece that democratizes the lobster experience by bringing portion-controlled, gourmet crustacean production to the smallest urban spaces.
