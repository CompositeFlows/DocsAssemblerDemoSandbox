‘Pocket-Lob’ is a revolutionary dwarf freshwater lobster strain developed through selective breeding of small crayfish species to achieve the ultimate compact crustacean. This cultivar matures at a precise size yielding a tail that perfectly fits between two fingers - approximately 40-50 grams of pure, sweet meat. Displaying a deep navy blue shell with subtle crimson highlights in life that transforms to classic lobster red when cooked, ‘Pocket-Lob’ delivers the rich, sweet flavor and firm texture of marine lobster in a personal-sized freshwater package.
