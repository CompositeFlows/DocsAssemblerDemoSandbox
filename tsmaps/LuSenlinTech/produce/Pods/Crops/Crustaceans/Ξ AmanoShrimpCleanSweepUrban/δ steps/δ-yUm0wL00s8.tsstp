###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘CleanSweep Urban’ offers a deep, savory, almost oceanic flavor with a firm, substantial texture. Its flavor is more robust and less sweet than Neocaridina species, with a pronounced umami character. The meat is opaque and firm, requiring slightly longer cooking times. The shrimp themselves are larger and more active than typical ornamental cleaners, with a powerful, constant grazing motion that makes them exceptionally efficient.

**2. The Savory, Substantial Bonus Harvest**
This shrimp's larger size and savory profile make it suitable for dishes where a more pronounced shellfish flavor is desired.
- **Shrimp Stock and Broth:** The premier use - the shells and bodies create an incredibly rich, deeply flavored stock, ideal as a base for risottos, soups, and sauces.
- **Stir-fried in Shell:** Sautéed quickly with strong flavors like black bean sauce, chili, and garlic; the shell imparts immense flavor to the oil and sauce.
- **Boiled and Peeled:** A simple boil yields firm, flavorful meat that can be used in salads, pasta dishes, or fried rice.
- **Fermented Shrimp Paste:** Their potent flavor makes them an excellent candidate for creating high-quality, homemade shrimp paste or fermented shrimp sauce.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘CleanSweep Urban’ is a dedicated workhorse, constantly grazing on filamentous algae and biofilm. They do not breed in freshwater, so the population is stable and managed by the cultivator. In a mature AquaPod or planted system, a crew of 10-15 adults provides **continuous algae control, with the option to harvest the largest individuals every 3-4 months as they reach their maximum size of 5-6 cm.**
