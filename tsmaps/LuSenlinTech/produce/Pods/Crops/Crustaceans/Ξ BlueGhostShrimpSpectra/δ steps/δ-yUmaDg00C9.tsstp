###### The Science & Story Behind It

The unique qualities of ‘Spectra’ stem from stabilized pigment expression and enhanced growth characteristics.
- The stable blue coloration is achieved through selective breeding for specific iridophore cells that refract light to create the blue appearance, a trait that has been stabilized to prevent fading or reversion to the wild-type transparency.
- Its rapid growth and substantial size are results of selecting for efficient nutrient metabolism and delayed sexual maturity, allowing for greater biomass accumulation before breeding.
- The hardiness and adaptability are enhanced through multi-generational selection in captive conditions, creating a strain that thrives in the stable yet compact environment of urban aquaculture systems.

In short, **Blue Ghost Shrimp ‘Spectra’** is a **visually captivating, rapid-cycling, and flavor-delicate** cultivar, a functional workhorse that brings both ethereal beauty and a continuous supply of gourmet morsels to the urban aquaponic environment.
