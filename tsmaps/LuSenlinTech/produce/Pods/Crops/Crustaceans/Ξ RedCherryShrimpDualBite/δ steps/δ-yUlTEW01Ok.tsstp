###### The Science & Story Behind It

The success of ‘Dual-Bite’ lies in its balanced selection for both ornamental traits and productive characteristics.
- The intense red coloration is a result of selective breeding for maximum astaxanthin expression and uniform pigment distribution, a trait that also indicates a robust immune system and high-quality diet.
- The larger body size and rapid growth are achieved by selecting for individuals with efficient nutrient partitioning and a slightly longer growth period before sexual maturity.
- Its prolific breeding rate is a cornerstone of its utility; selecting for high fecundity and strong maternal instincts ensures a constant population turnover, allowing for regular harvests while maintaining the cleaning crew.
