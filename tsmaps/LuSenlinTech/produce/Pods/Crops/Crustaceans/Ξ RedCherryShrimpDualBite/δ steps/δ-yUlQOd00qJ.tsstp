###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Dual-Bite’ offers a surprisingly sweet, concentrated shrimp flavor with a delicate, crisp texture. The entire shrimp is edible, including the shell, which becomes pleasantly crisp when cooked. The meat is sweet and tender, with a flavor intensity that belies its small size. The shrimp themselves are vibrant fire-engine red, creating a beautiful visual display while performing their cleaning duties.

**2. The Snack-Sized Sweet Bite**
This shrimp's small size and sweet flavor make it ideal for applications where it can be eaten whole and appreciated for its concentrated taste.
- **Crispy Fried Whole:** The premier preparation - tossed in a light seasoning and fried until the entire shrimp is crisp, creating a savory, edible snack with a satisfying crunch.
- **Garnish for Soups and Salads:** A handful of boiled or sautéed shrimp adds a pop of color and a burst of sweet flavor to clear soups, ramen, or green salads.
- **Shrimp Paste and Stuffing:** Can be pureed into a fine, sweet paste for dumplings, wontons, or as a stuffing for vegetables.
- **Quick Sauté in Shell:** Sautéed quickly in a hot pan with garlic and oil, the shells become fragrant and crisp while the meat inside stays tender.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Dual-Bite’ is a continuous, self-sustaining producer in a stable, mature aquarium. They breed prolifically, creating a population that can be harvested regularly without depletion. In a balanced AquaPod or planted Shrimp Ring, a colony provides a **sustainable, ongoing yield of 30-50 harvest-sized shrimp per month from a 20-liter system, reaching edible size in 8-10 weeks from birth.**
