###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Harvest Nugget’ offers the signature summer truffle profile: a mild, pleasantly earthy flavor with distinct notes of hazelnut, fresh mushroom, and a hint of vanilla. Its aroma is subtle and approachable compared to winter truffles, making it versatile for various dishes. The flesh is firm and easy to slice or grate, with intricate, delicate white veining that gives each "nugget" a marbled appearance. The texture is pleasantly crisp when raw, softening beautifully when heated.

**2. The Versatile, Accessible Truffle**
This truffle's milder profile and reliable supply make it ideal for everyday gourmet cooking and applications where black or white truffles would be overpowering.
- **Grated over Pasta and Pizza:** A fantastic way to finish a wide range of dishes, from simple aglio e olio to creamy pizzas, adding a layer of earthy sophistication.
- **Infused into Creams and Sauces:** Grated and gently warmed in cream, butter, or béchamel sauce to infuse its flavor throughout a dish.
- **Compound Butters and Oils:** Perfect for creating more affordable, yet still luxurious, truffle butters and oils for long-term use.
- **Salads and Vegetable Sides:** Shaved raw over salads, roasted vegetables, or mashed potatoes to add a fresh, nutty dimension.

**3. The Harvest & Yield**
‘Harvest Nugget’ is a prolific and reliable fruiter, with a significantly accelerated timeline from inoculation to first harvest. The truffles form in the summer months, located by the subtle cracking of the soil surface above them. Supplied as an inoculated dwarf tree in a Truffle-Tower, a single plant provides a **substantial and consistent annual yield of 10-20 individual truffles, totaling 300-600g each summer, with first harvests often occurring as early as the second year.**
