‘Harvest Nugget’ is a rapid-cycling, compact strain of Burgundy summer truffle (*Tuber aestivum*) engineered for high-yield urban cultivation and consistent annual harvests. This cultivar produces a generous quantity of small, rounded truffles, typically 20-40 grams each, with a dark, warty exterior and fine, dense white marbling throughout the pale brown flesh. Selected for its abbreviated life cycle and robust symbiotic relationship with dwarf oak and hazel, ‘Harvest Nugget’ delivers the classic, subtle nutty and earthy flavor of summer truffle on a predictable, balcony-friendly timeline.
