###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Gold Thread’ has a mild, slightly sweet and mushroomy flavor with a firm, chewy texture. The fruiting bodies are slender, 3-6 cm tall, with a bright, golden-orange color and a characteristic club or worm-like shape. They grow in dense clusters, creating a striking "field of gold" across the substrate surface. While edible, the texture is somewhat tough and the flavor is subtle, making its primary value medicinal rather than culinary.

**2. The Functional Superfood**
This cordyceps is valued almost exclusively for its exceptional nutritional and adaptogenic properties.
- **Dual-Extraction Tinctures:** The most effective method for consumption; a hot water and alcohol extraction captures the full spectrum of water-soluble polysaccharides and alcohol-soluble cordycepin.
- **Teas and Decoctions:** Dried or fresh fruiting bodies can be simmered to make a mildly sweet, golden-hued functional tea.
- **Powdered Supplement:** Once dried, the tough fruiting bodies can be ground into a fine powder for encapsulation or adding to smoothies and elixirs.
- **Broth and Soup Infusion:** A small amount can be used to brew a nutrient-dense broth, though the flavor is very mild.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Gold Thread’ is a rapid, synchronous fruiter under precise conditions. Harvest the entire crop when the majority of fruiting bodies have reached their full height and developed their brightest orange color, but before they begin to darken or produce spores. Supplied as a pre-colonized {{tm.mycoBlockTM}}, it provides a **dense, single flush yielding 150–300g of fresh, potent Cordyceps, typically ready for harvest 4-5 weeks after inoculation.**
