‘Snow Cluster’ is a pristine, white-clustering strain of Shimeji (*Hypsizygus tessellatus*) selected for its elegant appearance and refined flavor profile in container cultivation. This cultivar produces tight bouquets of small, smooth, snow-white caps atop slender, upright stems, creating a clean, minimalist aesthetic. Unlike the more common brown shimeji, ‘Snow Cluster’ offers a milder, sweeter, and distinctly nutty flavor with a crisp, clean bite, making it a versatile and visually stunning choice for both classic and modern dishes.
