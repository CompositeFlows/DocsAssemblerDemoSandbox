‘Candy-Cap’ is a vibrant, heat-loving pink oyster mushroom (*Pleurotus djamor*) strain celebrated for its stunning visual appeal and unique, robust flavor. This tropical cultivar produces brilliant salmon-pink to coral-colored caps that retain their striking hue better than standard pink oysters, even in lower light conditions. Selected for its vigorous growth and firm texture, ‘Candy-Cap’ delivers a surprisingly bold, savory-sweet flavor with distinct ham-like and seafood notes, making it a spectacular culinary and visual standout.
