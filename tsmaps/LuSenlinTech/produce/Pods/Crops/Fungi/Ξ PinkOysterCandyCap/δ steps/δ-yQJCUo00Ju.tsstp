###### The Science & Story Behind It

The distinction of ‘Candy-Cap’ lies in its enhanced pigment stability and flavor compound concentration.
- The stable, vibrant pink coloration results from selecting for strains with high carotenoid pigment production and retention, specifically canthaxanthin, which maintains color integrity even with moderate light exposure.
- Its intense ham-and-seafood flavor profile comes from elevated levels of guanylic acid and specific sulfur compounds that create the characteristic savory and oceanic notes, making it one of the most flavorful oyster varieties.
- The firm, non-slimy texture is achieved through selective breeding for thicker cell walls and lower water content in the fruiting bodies, allowing it to maintain structure during cooking.

In short, **Pink Oyster ‘Candy-Cap’** is a **color-stable, flavor-bold, and heat-adapted** tropical mushroom, a spectacular cultivar that brings both dazzling visual appeal and profound umami depth to urban cultivation.
