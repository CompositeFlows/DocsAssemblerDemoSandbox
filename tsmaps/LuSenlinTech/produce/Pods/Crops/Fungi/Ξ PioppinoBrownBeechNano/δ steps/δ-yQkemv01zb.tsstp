‘Brown Beech Nano’ is a dwarf, cluster-fruiting strain of Pioppino (*Cyclocybe aegerita*, syn. *Agrocybe cylindracea*) specifically selected for its compact growth habit and prolific yield in container culture. This cultivar produces dense bouquets of small, smooth, caramel to chestnut-brown caps atop slender, firm stems, maintaining the classic form of its larger relatives but in a perfectly patio-proportioned size. ‘Brown Beech Nano’ delivers the highly prized flavor - a complex blend of almond, poplar, and white wine - with remarkable intensity, making it a gourmet treasure for the space-conscious cultivator.
