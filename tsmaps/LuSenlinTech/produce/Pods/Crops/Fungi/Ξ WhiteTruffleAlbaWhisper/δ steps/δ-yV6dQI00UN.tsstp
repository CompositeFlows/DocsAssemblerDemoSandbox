###### The Science & Story Behind It

The cultivation of ‘Alba Whisper’ represents the absolute frontier of mycology, solving the mystery of *Tuber magnatum*'s stubborn resistance to domestication.
- The successful containerized symbiosis was achieved by isolating a less temperamental strain of *T. magnatum* and pairing it with a genetically modified dwarf poplar whose root exudates perfectly mimic the complex chemical signals of mature, wild trees in the Alba region.
- The preservation of the iconic aroma is the result of selecting for truffles that produce an exceptionally high concentration of volatile sulfur compounds, particularly bis(methylthio)methane, and creating a substrate microbiome that supports their development without the need for a vast forest ecosystem.
- The controlled fruiting in a non-native climate is managed by a "season-simulating" watering and temperature regime for the Truffle-Tower, which tricks the mycorrhizal network into following its natural autumn fruiting cycle.

In short, **White Truffle ‘Alba Whisper’** is an **aroma-transcendent, scientifically-miraculous, and space-defying** cultivar, a pinnacle of gourmet gardening that offers a whisper of the Italian forest's deepest, most precious secret to the dedicated urban epicurean.
