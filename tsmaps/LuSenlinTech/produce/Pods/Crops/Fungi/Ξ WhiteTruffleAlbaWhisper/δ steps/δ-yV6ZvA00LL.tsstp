###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Alba Whisper’ delivers the sublime, intoxicating aroma that defines the white truffle: an unparalleled blend of wild mushrooms, fermented honey, garlic, and wet earth, with a subtle, musky sweetness that defies description. The flesh is pale cream to light brown, marbled with fine, delicate white veining. The texture is firmer than wild specimens, allowing for clean shaving, but still delicately yielding. Its aroma is so potent it can perfume an entire room.

**2. The Fragrant Culinary Jewel**
This truffle’s value is almost entirely in its transcendent aroma, which is best appreciated raw and added at the very last second to simple, rich dishes.
- **Fresh Shaving over Tajarin:** The ultimate preparation - lavishly shaved over fresh, egg-rich tajarin pasta tossed only in butter, allowing its aroma to dominate.
- **Carnaroli Risotto:** A classic pairing; shaved over a creamy, parmesan-laced risotto just before serving, where the heat unlocks its full spectrum of scents.
- **Uovo in Camicia:** The simple, perfect pairing of a softly fried or poached egg, where the truffle’s complexity melds with the rich yolk.
- **Butter and Salt Infusion:** Gently folded into softened butter or high-quality sea salt to create a versatile, aromatic condiment that preserves its essence.

**3. The Harvest & Yield**
‘Alba Whisper’ fruits in the autumn. Harvest is a precise art, triggered not by sight but by the faint, heavenly scent that begins to emanate from the base of its host tree. Each truffle is located by its aroma and carefully unearthed by hand. Supplied as an inoculated dwarf tree in a specialized Truffle-Tower, a mature plant provides an **exquisite and limited annual yield of 2-5 individual truffles, totaling 30-80g each autumn, typically beginning in its fourth year.**
