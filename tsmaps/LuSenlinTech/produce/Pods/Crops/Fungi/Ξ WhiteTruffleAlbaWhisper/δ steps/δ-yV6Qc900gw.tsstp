‘Alba Whisper’ is a breathtaking horticultural achievement - a cultivated strain of the legendary Piedmont white truffle (*Tuber magnatum*) adapted for symbiotic growth with dwarf poplar and willow trees in containerized urban systems. This cultivar captures the ethereal, complex aroma of its wild Alba counterparts, producing small, irregular fruiting bodies of 10-20 grams with the signature pale ochre, smooth exterior. Breaking from a millennia-old tradition of foraging, ‘Alba Whisper’ brings the most elusive and aromatic of all truffles into the realm of controlled cultivation on a balcony or patio.
