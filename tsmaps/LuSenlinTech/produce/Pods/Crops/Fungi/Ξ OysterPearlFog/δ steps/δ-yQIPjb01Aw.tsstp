‘Pearl-Fog’ is a high-yielding, fast-colonizing oyster mushroom (*Pleurotus ostreatus*) strain selected for its remarkable adaptability to the fluctuating conditions of a balcony environment. This cultivar produces stunning, overlapping clusters of smooth, pearl-gray caps that maintain their classic, delicate shape and thin, pliable flesh even through minor temperature and humidity swings. ‘Pearl-Fog’ delivers the quintessential oyster mushroom flavour - a mild, sweet nuttiness with a subtle anise-like aroma - making it the most reliable and versatile choice for the urban mycologist.
