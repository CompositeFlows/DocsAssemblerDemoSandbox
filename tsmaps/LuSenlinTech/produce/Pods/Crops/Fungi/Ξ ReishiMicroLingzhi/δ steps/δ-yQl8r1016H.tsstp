‘Micro-Lingzhi’ is a dwarf, antler-predominant strain of Reishi (*Ganoderma lingzhi*) developed specifically for the efficient production of functional, medicinal-grade fruiting bodies in a compact container format. This cultivar primarily forms elegant, branching antler-like structures with a glossy, lacquered crimson surface, forgoing the large, kidney-shaped caps of traditional Reishi in favor of a form that maximizes the concentration of bioactive compounds per gram of biomass. ‘Micro-Lingzhi’ is cultivated not for culinary texture, but for its exceptionally high triterpenoid and polysaccharide content, destined for dual-extraction tonics, teas, and powders.
