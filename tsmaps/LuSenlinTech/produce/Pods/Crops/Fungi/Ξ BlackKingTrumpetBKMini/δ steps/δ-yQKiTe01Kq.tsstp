‘BK-Mini’ is a dwarf, high-yielding strain of Black King Trumpet (*Pleurotus ostreatus* var. *columbinus*) bred specifically for compact container production. This cultivar produces clusters of striking, gunmetal-gray to charcoal-black caps atop thick, meaty stems that are shorter and stouter than standard king varieties. Despite its smaller stature, ‘BK-Mini’ delivers an intensely concentrated, savory flavor and a remarkably firm, steak-like texture, making it the ultimate space-efficient mushroom for substantial culinary applications.
