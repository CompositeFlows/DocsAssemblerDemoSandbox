###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Urban Knot’ delivers the authentic, complex profile of a Périgord black truffle: an intense, earthy aroma with profound notes of dark chocolate, forest floor, and a subtle, spicy sweetness. The flesh is firm and marbled, transitioning from dark brown to jet black with intricate, stark white veining as it matures. The truffles themselves are small, typically 15-25 grams, and often form in charming, irregularly rounded "knots" close to the soil surface.

**2. The Ultimate Culinary Fragrance**
This truffle's potent aroma and flavor make it a precious ingredient for infusing dishes with unparalleled depth, used sparingly to elevate simple preparations.
- **Fresh Shaving over Pasta and Risotto:** The premier use - thinly shaved over warm, butter-based pasta, risotto, or scrambled eggs, where the heat releases its volatile aromatics.
- **Infused Oils and Butters:** Finely grated and steeped into high-quality oils or folded into butter, creating a versatile truffle base that preserves its essence.
- **Savory Desserts and Sauces:** A surprising but sublime addition to dark chocolate ganache or rich, wine-based pan sauces for red meat.
- **Aromatic Garnish:** Used as a final, fragrant garnish on creamy soups or delicate canapés.

**3. The Harvest & Yield**
‘Urban Knot’ fruits in the winter months, signaled by the appearance of a "burn" (zone of barren soil) around the base of its host tree and the faint, tell-tale scent permeating the air. Harvest is a delicate process, carefully excavating the soil around the base of the dwarf tree to locate the mature truffles by their peak aroma. Supplied as an inoculated dwarf tree in a Truffle-Tower, a single mature plant provides a **precious annual yield of 3-8 individual truffles, totaling 60-150g per winter season, typically beginning in its third year.**
