‘Urban Knot’ is a revolutionary, dwarf-symbiotic strain of Périgord black truffle (*Tuber melanosporum*) engineered to form its prized fruiting bodies in compact, containerized root systems. This breakthrough cultivar partners with genetically selected dwarf hazel and oak trees, triggering truffle formation in less than three years - a fraction of the time required in traditional orchards. The mycorrhizal network is confined to a specialized, self-contained "Truffle-Tower" pot, making the cultivation of this legendary fungus a tangible reality on a sun-drenched balcony.
