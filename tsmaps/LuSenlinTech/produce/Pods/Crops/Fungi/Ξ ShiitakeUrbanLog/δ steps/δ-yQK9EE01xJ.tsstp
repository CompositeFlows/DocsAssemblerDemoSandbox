‘Urban Log’ is a compact, fast-fruiting shiitake (*Lentinula edodes*) strain specifically developed for container cultivation on enriched, high-density substrate blocks. This cultivar bypasses the traditional log-growing requirement, instead producing generous clusters of classic, umbrella-shaped caps with the authentic, robust shiitake flavor and aroma. Selected for its ability to fruit reliably in the stable environment of a balcony, ‘Urban Log’ delivers the prized meaty texture and deeply savory taste of forest-grown shiitake in a fraction of the time and space.
