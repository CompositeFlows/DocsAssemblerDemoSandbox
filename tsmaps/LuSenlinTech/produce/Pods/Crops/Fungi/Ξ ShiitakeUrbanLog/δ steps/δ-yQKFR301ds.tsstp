###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Urban Log’ offers the quintessential shiitake profile: an intensely savory, meaty, and slightly smoky flavor with the distinct aromatic richness that defines this culinary treasure. The caps are thick-fleshed, convex to flat when mature, with a classic tan to dark brown color and distinctive white crackling patterns on the surface when conditions are ideal. The texture is exceptionally meaty and substantial, standing up to long cooking times.

**2. The Ultimate Umami Powerhouse**
This mushroom's profound savory depth and hearty texture make it a foundational ingredient in countless dishes.
- **Sautéed and Stir-fried:** Sliced and seared over high heat to develop a beautiful brown crust, intensifying its innate umami and adding depth to vegetable and noodle dishes.
- **Broths and Stocks:** The premier choice for creating rich, deeply flavored vegetarian dashi, mushroom stock, or as the base for ramen and pho.
- **Braised and Stewed:** Its robust texture holds up magnificently in long-simmered dishes, stews, and braises, where it absorbs flavors while contributing its own meaty character.
- **Grilled or Roasted:** Whole caps brushed with oil and grilled or roasted develop a chewy, bacon-like texture and concentrated flavor.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Urban Log’ is induced to fruit through a controlled "cold shock" and fresh air exchange, mimicking the environmental triggers of its natural habitat. Harvest when the caps are partially to fully opened but before the gills begin to darken significantly and spores are released. Supplied as a pre-colonized {{tm.mycoBlockTM}}, it provides a **substantial yield of 500–800g of meaty caps over 2-3 major flushes, with the first harvest ready 5-10 days after the cold shock trigger.**
