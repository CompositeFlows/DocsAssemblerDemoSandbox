‘Fractal Feathers’ is a dwarf, cluster-forming strain of Maitake (*Grifola frondosa*) that masterfully condenses the iconic, frond-like structure of this revered mushroom into a compact, container-friendly form. This cultivar produces dense, overlapping clusters of delicate, tongue-shaped caps with the signature wavy, gray-brown patterning, creating a miniature masterpiece of fractal beauty. ‘Fractal Feathers’ delivers the same rich, earthy, and peppery-aromatic flavor of wild Maitake (Hen of the Woods) with a surprisingly tender texture, making it both a visual spectacle and a culinary prize for the balcony cultivator.
