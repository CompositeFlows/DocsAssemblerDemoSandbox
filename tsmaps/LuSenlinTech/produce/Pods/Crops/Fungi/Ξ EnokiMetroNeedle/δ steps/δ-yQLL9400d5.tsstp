###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Metro-Needle’ offers a delicate, slightly sweet and fruity flavor with a clean, crisp bite. The caps are small, honey-gold to amber-brown, and convex, topping slender, wiry stems that are pale tan and develop a characteristic velvety texture at the base. The mushrooms grow in dense, upright clusters resembling a miniature forest, with stems reaching 8-12 cm in height - long and elegant, yet sturdier than commercially forced varieties.

**2. The Delicate Crunch & Soup Specialist**
This mushroom’s unique texture and mild flavor make it ideal for dishes where subtlety and mouthfeel are paramount.
- **Hot Pot and Soup Essential:** The premier use - added to miso soup, ramen, or hot pots during the final moments of cooking, where they wilt slightly but retain a pleasant, al dente crunch.
- **Salads and Crudité:** Raw, young clusters can be separated and added to salads for a crisp, mild mushroom flavor and elegant appearance.
- **Quick Sauté or Stir-fry:** Cooked very briefly over high heat to preserve their crisp-tender texture, perfect for noodle dishes and vegetable sautés.
- **Garnish with Texture:** Used as a delicate, edible garnish for soups and Asian-inspired dishes, providing both visual appeal and a subtle crunch.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Metro-Needle’ is a cool-weather fruiter that produces abundant clusters. Harvest entire clusters by twisting at the base when the majority of caps are open but before the stems become tough. Supplied as a pre-colonized {{tm.mycoBlockTM}}, it provides a **prolific yield of numerous dense clusters totaling 300–500g, with fruiting typically occurring in flushes during cooler temperatures, 14-20 days after initiation.**
