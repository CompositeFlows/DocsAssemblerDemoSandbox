‘Metro-Needle’ is a compact, cluster-forming strain of enoki (*Flammulina velutipes*) selected for its elegant, elongated form and ability to fruit in the higher-light, lower-humidity conditions of a balcony environment. Unlike commercial enoki grown in high-CO2 conditions to produce pale, stringy mushrooms, ‘Metro-Needle’ develops the beautiful golden-brown caps and slender, velvety stems of its natural form. This cultivar delivers the classic crisp, slightly fruity flavor of wild enoki while maintaining the delicate texture that makes it a culinary treasure.
