###### The Science & Story Behind It

The innovation of ‘Stubby-King’ lies in its radically altered morphology, prioritizing stem girth over vertical growth.
- The dramatically shortened, thickened stem is a result of selecting for a specific expression of genes controlling cell division and elongation in the stipe (stem), creating a mushroom that invests resources radially rather than vertically.
- The underdeveloped cap is a correlated trait; by selecting for mushrooms that prioritize stem growth, the energy typically allocated to cap expansion is redirected, resulting in the small, tight cap formation.
- The intense umami and firm texture are a product of the high density of the stem tissue, which concentrates flavor compounds and creates a lower water content per volume, leading to the superior searing and chewing qualities.

In short, **King Oyster ‘Stubby-King’** is a **texture-dense, flavor-rich, and space-optimized** culinary workhorse, a breeding marvel that delivers the most desirable part of the King Oyster in a concentrated, patio-perfect form.
