###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Honey-Drop’ offers the quintessential honeydew profile: an intensely sweet, clean, and subtly floral flavour with a high water content that makes it exceptionally refreshing. The melons are perfectly round, slightly smaller than a grapefruit, with a smooth, creamy white rind that develops a slight yellow blush and a waxy feel when ripe. The flesh is pale celadon green, succulent, and aromatic. The vine is manageable, typically extending just 1-1.5 meters, making it ideal for a small trellis.

**2. The Ultimate Personal Dessert Melon**
This melon’s perfect single-serving size and classic flavour make it a luxurious treat for one or two.
- **Chilled Fresh Perfection:** The ultimate way to enjoy it is simply chilled and sliced, allowing its pure, sweet flavour and juicy texture to shine.
- **Prosciutto-Wrapped Appetizer:** A classic pairing, where its cool sweetness perfectly balances the salty, savoury richness of cured meats.
- **Fruit Salads & Skewers:** Cubed, it adds a sweet, refreshing element to fruit salads or can be threaded onto skewers with other summer fruits.
- **Blended Beverages & Sorbets:** Its high sugar content and delicate flavour make it ideal for fresh melon juice, smoothies, or pure, vibrant sorbets.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Honey-Drop’ is a determined, focused producer. The plant will set 2-4 primary melons, which should be supported in slings as they mature. Ripeness is indicated by a subtle colour change from green to creamy yellow, a slight softening at the blossom end, and a powerful, sweet aroma. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a **precious yield of 2-3 perfectly ripe, personal-sized melons per season, with fruit ready for harvest 75-85 days from transplant.**
