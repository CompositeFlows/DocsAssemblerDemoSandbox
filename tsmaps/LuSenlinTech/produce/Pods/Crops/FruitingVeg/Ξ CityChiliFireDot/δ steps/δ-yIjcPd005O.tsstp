‘FireDot’ is a blazingly productive, ultra-compact ornamental chili pepper that packs a serious punch. Designed for maximum visual impact and culinary heat in a minimal footprint, this dwarf plant is perpetually covered in a stunning display of upright, needle-like fruits that mature from violet to cream, then orange, and finally to a deep, fiery red. It is the ultimate dual-purpose plant, serving as a living ornament and a ready-to-use spice rack for the adventurous urban cook.
