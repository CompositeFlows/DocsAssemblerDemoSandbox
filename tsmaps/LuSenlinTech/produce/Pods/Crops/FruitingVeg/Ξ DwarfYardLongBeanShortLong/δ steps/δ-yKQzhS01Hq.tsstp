‘Short-Long’ is a revolutionary, bushy cultivar of the traditional vining yard-long bean, engineered for maximum productivity in minimum space. This dwarf plant forgoes the extensive vines of its ancestors in favor of a compact, shrub-like habit, yet it still produces a remarkable abundance of slender, tender pods that reach a manageable 30-40 cm in length. It delivers the classic, earthy-sweet flavor and unique texture of a yard-long bean, making this Asian staple accessible to every balcony gardener.
