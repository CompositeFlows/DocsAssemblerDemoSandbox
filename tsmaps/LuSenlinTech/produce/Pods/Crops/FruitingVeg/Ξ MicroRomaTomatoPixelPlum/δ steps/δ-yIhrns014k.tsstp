###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Pixel-Plum’ offers a highly concentrated, classic Roma flavour: intensely rich and tangy with low juiciness and very high solids content. The fruits are small, plum-shaped, and weigh 15-20 grams each, with a thick, robust skin that protects the dense, nearly seedless, meaty interior. The plant is a true micro-dwarf, forming a dense, dark green mound that rarely exceeds 25 cm in height.

**2. The Sauce & Preservation Specialist**
This tomato’s culinary value is defined by its exceptional dry matter content, making it inefficient for fresh salads but peerless for processing.
- **Concentrated Sauces & Pastes:** Its high pectin and solid content mean it reduces into a thick, deeply flavoured sauce or paste in half the time of standard tomatoes, with an unparalleled rich, tangy taste.
- **Oven-Drying & Dehydrating:** The perfect tomato for making balcony "sun-dried" tomatoes in a dehydrator or low oven. Its meaty flesh dehydrates quickly into a chewy, flavour-packed treat.
- **Stuffed Appetizers:** The small, firm, and hollow-friendly shape makes them ideal for roasting or grilling whole when stuffed with herbs, cheese, or grains.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
As a determinate micro-dwarf, ‘Pixel-Plum’ sets a massive, synchronized crop. The plant becomes a single, prolific unit of ripening fruit. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant delivers a **surprisingly heavy yield of 0.8–1.2 kg of dense, meaty fruits, with the entire harvest ripening uniformly within a 10-day window, approximately 65 days from transplant.**
