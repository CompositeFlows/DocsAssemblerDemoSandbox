###### The Science & Story Behind It

The innovation of ‘Pixel-Plum’ is a masterclass in miniaturization and resource allocation for a specific culinary function.
- The extreme compactness is governed by a combination of dwarfing rootstock genetics and a potent "micro" allele that drastically shortens internode length, creating a super-dense plant structure capable of supporting a heavy fruit load without collapsing.
- Its exceptionally high solids content (up to 30% higher than standard Romas) is achieved by selecting for plants with enlarged parenchyma cells in the fruit flesh and a significant reduction in the size of the seed locules and water-storing gel.
- The flavour concentration is a direct result of this dry matter density; the sugars, acids, and aromatic compounds are not diluted in a watery matrix. This is further enhanced by a unique expression of glutamate compounds, which contribute a savory, umami depth perfect for cooked sauces.

In short, **Micro Roma Tomato ‘Pixel-Plum’** is a **dense, meaty, and hyper-compact** paste tomato, a specialist cultivar that sacrifices juiciness for concentrated flavour and yield, delivering the essence of a Italian kitchen garden from a single pot.
