‘EverPink’ is a day-neutral alpine strawberry cultivar that delivers a continuous harvest of delicate, pastel-pink berries from spring until the first frost. Bred for both ornamental charm and a uniquely sweet, tropical flavour profile, this compact perennial forms tidy, dark green mounds adorned with small, five-petaled white flowers and a constant supply of fruit. Unlike traditional red strawberries, ‘EverPink’ retains its soft blush colour even when fully ripe, adding a touch of elegance and surprise to the balcony garden.
