###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘EverPink’ offers a complex and surprisingly sweet flavour with distinct notes of pineapple, wild strawberry, and a floral hint of rose. The berries are small, conical, and firm, with a pale pink to peach-coloured skin and a correspondingly pale, aromatic interior. The plant is a clump-forming, non-runnering perennial that stays neatly within its allotted space, making it ideal for pots, towers, and edging.

**2. The Elegant, Aromatic Garnish**
This strawberry’s primary value lies in its exquisite appearance and aromatic flavour, which is best appreciated fresh and unadorned.
- **Fresh Dessert Topper:** The beautiful colour and tropical aroma make it a stunning garnish for cakes, pavlovas, panna cotta, and cheesecakes, where its unique flavour can be savoured.
- **Elegant Salads:** Whole or halved, they add a sweet, surprising element to green salads or fruit salads, creating a sophisticated flavour combination.
- **Chilled Beverages:** A perfect, fragrant addition to a glass of champagne, sparkling water, or iced tea, where they act as both a flavour infuser and a beautiful visual element.
- **Pure Luxury, Fresh Eating:** Their small size and intense, candy-like sweetness make them irresistible for fresh eating straight from the plant.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
As a day-neutral variety, ‘EverPink’ is not governed by day length and will fruit continuously throughout the growing season once established. Harvest berries when they are fully coloured and slightly soft to the touch. Supplied as an RFID-tagged starter plant, a single crown provides a **steady, modest yield of several dozen exquisite berries per month, offering a constant supply of gourmet fruit from its first year onward.**
