‘Sun-Dot’ is the quintessential balcony cherry tomato, a cultivar perfected for life in the sky. It produces trusses of perfectly round, scarlet-red fruits that gleam like captured sunbeams against a dense, dark green foliage canopy. Bred for a robust, determinate bush habit, it requires no staking and dedicates its energy to producing a spectacular, concentrated flush of fruit, delivering the taste of high summer from the smallest of spaces.
