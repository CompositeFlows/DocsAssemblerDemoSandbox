###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Metro-Sakura’ offers a surprisingly delicate and sweet flavour with none of the astringency or bitterness often associated with larger eggplants. The fruits are small, oblong, and perfectly portioned, typically 5-7 cm long, with a stunning, glossy lavender-pink skin and creamy white interior. The plant itself is a compact, bushy specimen, rarely exceeding 40 cm in height and width, with a graceful, ornamental habit.

**2. The Gourmet Single-Serving Specialty**
This eggplant’s beauty and mildness make it ideal for elegant, simple preparations where its form and flavour can shine.
- **Whole-Roasted or Grilled:** Its small size and tender skin make it perfect for roasting or grilling whole. The flesh becomes custardy and sweet, ideal for serving as a single side dish.
- **Pickled and Preserved:** The beautiful color and firm texture hold up superbly in quick-pickle brines, creating a stunning and delicious condiment.
- **Sautéed and in Stir-fries:** Can be cooked whole or halved in minutes, absorbing sauces beautifully without falling apart.
- **The Centerpiece:** Its exquisite appearance makes it a natural focal point in a vegetable medley or as an edible garnish for plating.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Metro-Sakura’ is a prolific and early-bearing plant. Harvest the fruits as soon as the skin becomes glossy and firm for the best texture and sweetness. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a **continuous and decorative yield of 15-25 flawless mini-eggplants over the season, with the first harvest ready in just 55 days from transplant.**
