‘Metro-Sakura’ is a breathtakingly beautiful and highly productive miniature eggplant that redefines what’s possible in container gardening. This dwarf cultivar is celebrated not only for its delicate, lavender-pink fruits that resemble blooming cherry blossoms but also for its exceptionally tender, sweet, and non-bitter flesh. Growing in elegant, hanging clusters against silvery-green foliage, ‘Metro-Sakura’ is a dual-purpose gem that serves as a living floral display and a source of gourmet, single-serving vegetables.
