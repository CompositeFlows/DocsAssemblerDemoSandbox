‘Skyline Sugar’ is a dwarf, self-supporting snap pea bred specifically for vertical productivity and effortless harvesting on the urban balcony. This cultivar combines a compact, bushy stature with an astonishingly high yield of fat, succulent pods. Unlike traditional vining peas, ‘Skyline Sugar’ grows in a dense, upright column, eliminating the need for extensive trellising while delivering the same crisp, sweet flavour that defines the perfect snap pea.
