###### The Science & Story Behind It

The breakthrough of ‘City-Zuke’ lies in its radically altered plant architecture and sustained fruit set.
- The compact, bushy habit is a result of a strongly expressed dwarfing gene that suppresses internode elongation, creating a plant that invests its energy in fruit production rather than vine growth. The upright leaf presentation minimizes shading, maximizing photosynthesis in a small footprint.
- Its reliable yield in a constrained environment is achieved by selecting for a high ratio of female to male flowers and a prolonged period of flower initiation, ensuring a steady, manageable set of fruits rather than an overwhelming glut.
- The fruit's tender skin and slow seed development are key quality traits. Breeders selected for genes that delay the lignification (toughening) of the skin and the maturation of seeds, significantly extending the optimal harvest window for a perfect, tender squash.

In short, **Dwarf Zucchini ‘City-Zuke’** is a **space-smart, high-yielding, and culinary-classic** squash, a genetic innovation that brings the abundant harvest of a summer garden to the heart of the city.
