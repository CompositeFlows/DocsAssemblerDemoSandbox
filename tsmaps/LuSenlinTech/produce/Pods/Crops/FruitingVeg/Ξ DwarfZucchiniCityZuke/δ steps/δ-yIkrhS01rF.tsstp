###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘City-Zuke’ offers the quintessential, versatile zucchini flavour: a mild, slightly sweet and nutty profile that readily absorbs other flavours. The fruits are a deep emerald green, straight, and glossy, typically growing to 15-18 cm in length while remaining tender and seedless. The plant's form is its key innovation - a dense, open bush with short internodes and upright leaves, reaching only 45 cm in diameter and requiring no trailing.

**2. The Compact Summer Squash Workhorse**
This zucchini’s value is in its space efficiency and classic culinary performance.
- **Grilled or Sautéed:** Sliced into rounds or planks, it grills and sautés beautifully, developing a sweet, caramelized exterior while staying firm and tender.
- **Zucchini Noodles ("Zoodles"):** Its straight, uniform shape and firm texture make it ideal for spiralizing into a low-carb, gluten-free pasta alternative.
- **Baking and Fritters:** Grated, it is perfect for moist zucchini bread, muffins, or crispy fritters, where its mild flavour acts as a perfect canvas for spices and herbs.
- **Stuffed Zucchini Boats:** The smaller, tender fruits are excellent for halving and stuffing with grains, meats, and cheeses for a complete meal.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘City-Zuke’ is a continuously productive plant. For the best texture and flavour, harvest fruits frequently when they are young and skin is still glossy. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a **surprisingly abundant and steady yield, producing 8-12 tender fruits over the main season, with the first harvest ready for picking approximately 50 days from transplant.**
