##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar represents the pinnacle of culinary bio-engineering:
- The "4.1" designation signifies its lineage; it is the result of four generations of phenotypic selection for compact growth and oil density, with a final, stable genetic tweak (the ".1") to virtually eliminate premature flowering (bolting), ensuring a long harvest window.
- The signature basil aroma comes from a high concentration of linalool and estragole, volatile compounds that are most potent just before the plant flowers. By delaying bolting, '4.1' maintains peak flavour for weeks longer than standard varieties.
- Unlike many dwarf plants, it has not sacrificed flavour for size. Its compact stature is due to shorter internodal spacing, meaning the leaves - and their oil glands - are actually more densely packed than in a larger plant.

In short, **Mini-Sweet Basil 4.1** is a **genetically stabilized flavour bomb**, a living testament to the idea that the most authentic tastes can be perfected for modern life, delivering the soul of Italy from a single, prolific plant on your balcony.
