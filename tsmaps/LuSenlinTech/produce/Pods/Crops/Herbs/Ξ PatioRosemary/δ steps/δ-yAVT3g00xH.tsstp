##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘AromiStax’ offers the quintessential, powerful rosemary profile: a bold, piney, and camphorous flavour with sharp, peppery notes and a clean, refreshing finish. Its needles are short, stiff, and densely packed around sturdy, upright stems, forming a narrow, columnar bush that resembles a miniature, aromatic conifer.

###### 2. The Robust Roasting Herb
This rosemary is a foundational flavour for hearty dishes that can stand up to its assertive character.
- **Roasted Meats & Vegetables:** The quintessential partner for lamb, pork, and chicken, as well as robust roasted vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and squash. Its sturdy sprigs can be used as aromatic skewers.
- **Breads & Focaccia:** Finely chopped needles kneaded into bread dough or sprinkled over focaccia create an unforgettable, savoury fragrance.
- **Infused Oils & Marinades:** Steeped in olive oil or used in marinades to impart its powerful, woody essence. A single sprig can transform a bottle of oil or a jar of olives.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a slow-growing, woody perennial with a strongly vertical habit. Harvest by snipping the tips of the stems or removing individual branches from the bottom to maintain its shape. Supplied as a pre-vegetated plug for a head start, it provides a **steady, year-round yield of 10–20g of potent needles per week from its compact form.**
