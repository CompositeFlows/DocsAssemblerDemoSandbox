##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar embodies the subtle chemistry that distinguishes fine herbs:
- While botanically a close relative of oregano (*Origanum majorana* vs. *Origanum vulgare*), its flavour profile is dominated by sabinene and terpinene, compounds that give it its characteristic sweet, pine-citrus aroma, rather than the pungent, medicinal carvacrol that defines Greek oregano.
- In ancient Greece and Rome, marjoram was a symbol of happiness and was used to crown newlyweds. Its gentle, uplifting scent was believed to ease grief and promote peace, a folklore that aligns with its calming, non-aggressive aromatic profile.
- The ‘Marj-Mini’ cultivar has been selected for shorter internodal spacing, meaning the leaves - and their precious oil glands - are packed more tightly together on the stem than in standard varieties, resulting in a higher yield of flavour from a smaller plant.

In short, **Sweet Marjoram ‘Marj-Mini’** is a **prolific pocket of fragrance**, a gentle yet generous herb that proves the most memorable flavours are often the softest spoken, offering a continuous harvest of sweet, floral complexity for your most refined dishes.
