##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Plum-Sage’ delivers a sophisticated sage profile: the classic earthy, slightly peppery, and camphorous base is complemented by subtle notes of plum and lemon, creating a more rounded and versatile flavour. Its leaves are small, velvety, and a deep, dusky plum-purple, forming a neat, well-branched mound.

###### 2. The Elegant Savoury Herb
This sage’s complex flavour and stunning colour elevate both rustic and refined dishes.
- **Brown Butter & Pasta:** The ultimate herb for sage brown butter sauce, served with pumpkin or butternut squash ravioli. Its colour and flavour create a visually and gustatorily stunning dish.
- **Roasted Meats & Stuffing:** A classic for seasoning poultry, pork, and in stuffings, where its warm, earthy notes are essential. The purple leaves add a beautiful, unexpected hue.
- **Infused Vinegars & Cocktails:** Steeps beautifully in vinegar or apple cider, creating a vibrantly coloured, flavourful base for dressings. It can also be muddled into sophisticated gin-based cocktails.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a woody, perennial shrub with a compact, mounding habit. Harvest individual leaves or small sprigs regularly to encourage new, colourful growth. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 10–20g of vibrant, aromatic leaves per week.**
