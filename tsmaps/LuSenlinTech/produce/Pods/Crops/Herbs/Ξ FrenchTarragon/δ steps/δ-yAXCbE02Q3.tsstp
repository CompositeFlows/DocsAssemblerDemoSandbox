##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Narrow-Leaf Nano’ offers the true tarragon signature: a sophisticated, sweet licorice-anise flavour with a distinct, pleasant peppery-astringent finish that lingers on the palate. Its leaves are long, narrow, glossy, and a vibrant dark green, growing on a compact, upright, and less woody plant than standard French tarragon.

###### 2. The Soul of French Sophistication
This herb is a cornerstone of French gastronomy and must be used with a delicate hand to preserve its nuanced flavour.
- **Fines Herbes & Béarnaise:** The essential, non-negotiable component of the *fines herbes* blend and the defining flavour in Béarnaise sauce, where its aniseed character complements the richness of egg yolk and butter.
- **Chicken & Seafood:** A classic pairing with chicken (*Poulet à l'Estragon*), fish (especially salmon), and in creamy sauces for shellfish, where its sweetness enhances without overpowering.
- **Vinegars & Dressings:** The premier herb for infusing white wine vinegar, creating a foundational ingredient for sophisticated vinaigrettes and marinades.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a sterile, clump-forming perennial that must be propagated from cuttings or divisions, which is how this cultivar is supplied as a pre-vegetated plug. Harvest by snipping the tips of the stems. It provides a **modest but potent yield of 5–15g of precious leaves per week. Its flavour is so intense that a few leaves are all that's needed.**
