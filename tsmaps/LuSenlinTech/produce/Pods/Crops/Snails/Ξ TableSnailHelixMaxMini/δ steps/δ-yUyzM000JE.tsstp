###### The Science & Story Behind It

The efficiency of ‘Helix Max-Mini’ lies in its accelerated lifecycle and intensified flavor profile.
- The dwarfism is achieved through selective breeding for early sexual maturity, redirecting energy from shell growth to rapid reproductive cycles and flavor development in the meat.
- The intensified earthy flavor results from selecting for snails with efficient conversion of their herbaceous diet into the complex flavor compounds that define high-quality escargot.
- Their adaptation to high-density communal living is a key urban trait, bred for reduced territorial behavior and enhanced disease resistance in confined spaces.

In short, **Table Snail ‘Helix Max-Mini’** is a **rapid-cycling, flavor-intense, and space-optimized** cultivar, a modern reinterpretation of a classic delicacy that brings the timeless tradition of escargot to the contemporary urban table.
