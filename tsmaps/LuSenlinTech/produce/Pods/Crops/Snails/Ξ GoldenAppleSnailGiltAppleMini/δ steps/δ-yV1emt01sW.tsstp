‘Gilt Apple Mini’ is a radiant, semi-aquatic strain of apple snail (*Pomacea bridgesii*) developed for its dual role as an ornamental aquarium resident and a sustainable protein source. This cultivar displays a stunning, metallic golden-yellow shell that appears gilded, with a compact size of 2-3 cm in diameter. Thriving at the water's edge in paludarium-style setups, ‘Gilt Apple Mini’ delivers a sweet, mild flavor with a firm yet tender texture, bridging the gap between terrestrial and aquatic snail cuisine.
