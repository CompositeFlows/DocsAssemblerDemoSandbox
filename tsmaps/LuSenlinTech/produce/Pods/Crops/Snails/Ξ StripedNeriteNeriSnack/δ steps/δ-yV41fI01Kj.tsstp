###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Neri-Snack’ offers an intensely sweet, clean marine flavor with subtle mineral notes and a firm, satisfying crunch. The meat is small but powerfully flavored, concentrating the essence of the ocean in a single bite. The texture is crisp yet tender - similar to a high-quality tiny clam. The shells are the standout feature: glossy with dramatic, alternating black and golden-yellow stripes that remain vibrant even after cooking, creating stunning visual appeal.

**2. The Ultimate Edible Garnish**
This nerite's brilliant appearance and concentrated flavor make it ideal for applications where visual impact and flavor punctuation are paramount.
- **Live Garnish for Oyster Platters:** The premier use - placed live on ice alongside oysters, then consumed as a palate-cleansing bite between shellfish varieties.
- **Soup and Broth Finisher:** Added whole to clear consommés and bisques just before serving, where they provide both visual drama and bursts of sweet flavor.
- **Sushi and Sashimi Accent:** Used as an elegant, edible decoration on sushi platters or as a tiny nigiri topping.
- **Crudo and Ceviche Component:** Their small size and sweet flavor make them perfect for raw preparations, requiring no cutting or preparation.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Neri-Snack’ is a constant, efficient grazer that thrives in stable marine conditions. They reproduce in brackish water but grow best in full seawater, making them non-invasive in closed systems. In a {{tm.haloponicTM}} marine setup, a colony provides a **continuous yield of 300-500 pristine snails per month from a 15-liter volume, reaching optimal size and flavor concentration of 1.8 cm in just 5-7 weeks while maintaining impeccable tank cleanliness.**
