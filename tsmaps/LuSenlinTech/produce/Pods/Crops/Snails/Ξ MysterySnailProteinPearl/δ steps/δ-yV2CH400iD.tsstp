###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Protein Pearl’ offers a clean, sweet flavor with distinct notes of freshwater crayfish and a hint of cucumber from its algal diet. The texture is firm yet tender, less chewy than terrestrial snails but with more substance than most aquatic varieties. The meat is pearly white and opaque when cooked, with a delicate flake similar to well-prepared scallops. The shells are thick and durable, displaying the species' characteristic color variations while providing excellent protection.

**2. The Versatile Aquatic Protein**
This snail's balanced flavor and substantial texture make it adaptable to both simple and complex preparations across multiple cuisines.
- **Garlic Butter Sauté:** Quickly sautéed in garlic butter with a splash of white wine, allowing its natural sweetness to shine through.
- **Snail and Potato Chowder:** Adds sweet, tender morsels to creamy chowders, where its flavor pairs beautifully with potatoes and bacon.
- **Stir-fry and Noodle Dishes:** Sliced or whole, it adds protein and sweetness to Asian-inspired stir-fries and noodle bowls.
- **Grilled in Shell:** Brushed with herb oil and grilled briefly in the shell, developing smoky notes while the meat steams inside.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Protein Pearl’ is a continuous grazer and prolific breeder in stable freshwater conditions. They efficiently convert algae and leftover fish food into high-quality protein while keeping tanks clean. In a balanced AquaPod system, a colony provides a **sustainable yield of 80-120 harvest-sized snails per month from a 20-liter volume, reaching optimal size of 3.5 cm in 8-10 weeks while continuously maintaining water quality.**
