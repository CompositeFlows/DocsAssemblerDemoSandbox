###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Petit Bourguignon’ offers a sophisticated, multi-layered flavor: initial notes of wild mushroom and toasted walnut, followed by a subtle sweetness and a clean, mineral finish. The texture is exceptionally tender yet substantial, melting smoothly without rubberiness. The shells are slightly thicker than other table snails, with beautiful cream and chestnut striping that makes them as visually appealing as they are delicious.

**2. The Premium Gastronomic Snail**
This snail's complex flavor and perfect texture make it the choice for discerning chefs and traditional preparations where quality is paramount.
- **Bourgogne-Style Escargot:** The definitive preparation - baked in their own shells with a rich blend of garlic, shallots, and fine Burgundy wine-infused butter.
- **Fine Pâtés and Mousses:** Creates exceptionally smooth, aromatic terrines where its nuanced flavor can be fully appreciated.
- **Wine-Braised Snails:** Slow-braised in red wine with pearl onions and herbs, creating a classic French bistro dish.
- **Salad and Garnish Specialist:** Poached and served cold in sophisticated salads or as an elegant garnish for composed dishes.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Petit Bourguignon’ thrives in cooler conditions (15-20°C) and develops its characteristic flavor during a longer, more deliberate growth period. They are less prolific but higher-quality breeders. In a climate-controlled {{tm.haloponicTM}}, a colony provides a **premium yield of 80-120 snails per month, reaching optimal flavor development and size of 3.5 cm in 12-14 weeks from hatching.**
