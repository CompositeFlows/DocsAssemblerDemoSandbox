‘Petit Bourguignon’ is a refined, cold-tolerant strain of Burgundy snail (*Helix pomatia*) selected for its exceptional flavor development and compact growth in urban environments. This cultivar develops the classic creamy, spherical shell with subtle brown banding, but reaches a modest 3-4 cm diameter - the ideal size for single-bite presentations. Bred for slower, more deliberate growth in cooler conditions, ‘Petit Bourguignon’ delivers a remarkably complex flavor profile with deep earthy notes, hints of forest floor, and a buttery texture that has made its larger ancestor the king of edible snails.
