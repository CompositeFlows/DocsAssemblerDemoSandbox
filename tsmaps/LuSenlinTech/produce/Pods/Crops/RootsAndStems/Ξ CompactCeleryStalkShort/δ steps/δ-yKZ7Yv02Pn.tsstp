‘Stalk-Short’ is a dwarf, self-blanching celery cultivar revolutionized for container production, delivering the classic aromatic, savory flavor of celery in a petite, manageable plant. This variety forms tight clusters of slender, crisp stalks that naturally grow pale yellow-green without the need for earthing up, reaching just 25-30 cm in height. Bred for intense flavor and minimal stringiness, ‘Stalk-Short’ makes the fresh, pungent taste of garden celery accessible to every balcony gardener.
