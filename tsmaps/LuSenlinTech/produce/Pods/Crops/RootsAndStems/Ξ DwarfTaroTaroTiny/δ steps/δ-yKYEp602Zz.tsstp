###### The Science & Story Behind It

The development of ‘Taro-Tiny’ represents a significant achievement in root crop miniaturization and oxalate management.
- The dwarf, clumping habit is the result of selecting for a suppressed lateral spreading gene and enhanced apical dominance, creating a plant that focuses energy on producing a compact cluster of corms rather than extensive underground runners.
- Its ability to produce quality corms in shallow soil is enabled by a modified root architecture that develops storage organs closer to the surface and in a more constricted space than wild varieties.
- While all taro contains calcium oxalate crystals that require cooking, ‘Taro-Tiny’ has been selected for lower raphide (needle-shaped crystal) density in both corms and leaves, reducing the irritant effect and making it somewhat safer to handle and prepare.

In short, **Dwarf Taro ‘Taro-Tiny’** is a **space-efficient, ornamental, and culinary-adapted** variety, bringing the exotic appeal and versatile nutrition of traditional taro within reach of urban container gardeners.
