‘Taro-Tiny’ is a truly compact cultivar of taro specifically developed for container production, bringing the staple root vegetable of tropical cuisines to temperate balcony gardens. This dwarf variety forms a tight clump of smaller, rounded corms with the classic earthy, nutty flavor, while its beautiful, heart-shaped leaves with dark purple accents provide striking ornamental value. Unlike traditional taro that requires deep soil and ample space, ‘Taro-Tiny’ thrives in standard pots, producing edible roots and leaves in a manageable, space-efficient form.
