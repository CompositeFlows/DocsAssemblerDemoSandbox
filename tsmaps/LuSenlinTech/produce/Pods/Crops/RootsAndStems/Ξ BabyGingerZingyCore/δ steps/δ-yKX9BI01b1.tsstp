###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Zingy Core’ delivers an exceptionally bright and complex flavor: an initial sharp, citrusy zing followed by floral notes and a clean, spicy finish without the woodiness of mature ginger. The rhizomes are small, knot-free, and pale gold with pink-tinged tips, featuring a juicy, crisp texture similar to a firm apple. The plant produces slender, reed-like pseudostems with narrow leaves, reaching just 45-50 cm in height.

**2. The Fresh Ginger Specialist**
This ginger’s tender texture and vibrant flavor make it ideal for applications where mature ginger would be too fibrous or harsh.
- **Finely Grated & Pastes:** Its low-fiber, juicy flesh grates effortlessly into a fine paste perfect for dressings, marinades, and sushi accompaniments.
- **Fresh Teas & Infusions:** Thinly sliced, it makes exceptionally aromatic and spicy ginger tea, syrups, and craft cocktail infusions.
- **Quick Pickles & Preserves:** Can be pickled whole or in thin slices to create tender, zesty *gari* (sushi ginger) or sweet ginger preserves.
- **Microplane Garnish:** A final sprinkle over finished dishes - from soups to stir-fries - adds a burst of fresh, floral heat.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Zingy Core’ is harvested young, typically 5-6 months after planting, before the rhizomes develop tough fibers. The entire plant can be lifted, or outer rhizomes can be carefully broken off while leaving the plant to continue growing. Supplied as an RFID-tagged pre-sprouted rhizome section, a single plant provides a **modest but high-quality yield of 150-250g of prime, young ginger, perfect for the home cook who values quality over quantity.**
