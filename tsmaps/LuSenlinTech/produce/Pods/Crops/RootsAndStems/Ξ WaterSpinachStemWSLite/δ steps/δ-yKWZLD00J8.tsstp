‘WS-Lite’ is a semi-aquatic cultivar of water spinach (*kangkong*) specifically engineered for compact, controlled growth in recirculating AquaPod systems. Unlike its vigorous, sprawling wild relatives, this variety focuses energy on producing an abundance of crisp, hollow stems and tender, arrowhead-shaped leaves with a markedly reduced spreading habit. It delivers the classic, mild, and slightly nutty flavour of water spinach, making this Asian aquatic green a manageable and productive crop for the aquatic urban farmer.
