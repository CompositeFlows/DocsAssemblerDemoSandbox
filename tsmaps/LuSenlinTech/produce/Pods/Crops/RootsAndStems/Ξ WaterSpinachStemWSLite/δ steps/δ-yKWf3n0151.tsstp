###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘WS-Lite’ offers a clean, mildly sweet and nutty flavour with a pleasing, succulent crunch from its hollow stems. The stems are crisp, juicy, and pale green, growing to a manageable 20-25 cm length, while the leaves are tender and dark green. The plant grows in a more upright, clumping form compared to traditional varieties, with a restrained root system ideal for aquatic inserts.

**2. The Stir-Fry and Soup Specialist**
This green’s unique texture and mild flavour make it a star in quick-cooked dishes, particularly in Southeast Asian cuisine.
- **Stir-fries (*Kangkong Belacan*):** The premier use; the hollow stems and leaves cook quickly, absorbing savory sauces like fermented shrimp paste (*belacan*) or garlic and soy while retaining a delightful crunch.
- **Soups and Noodle Dishes:** Adds a fresh, green element and tender-crisp texture to broths, ramen, and *laksa*, wilting perfectly in hot liquid.
- **Blanched Salads:** Can be briefly blanched and dressed with sesame oil, oyster sauce, and fried shallots for a simple, classic side dish.
- **Fresh Spring Rolls:** The tender leaves and young stems can be used as a fresh, crisp component in Vietnamese spring rolls (*gỏi cuốn*).

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘WS-Lite’ is a rapid-growing, cut-and-come-again aquatic green. Harvest by snipping stems 5-7 cm above the water line, which encourages the production of new side shoots. Supplied as an RFID-tagged rooted cutting for AquaPods, it provides a **continuous and prolific yield of 50-80g of stems and leaves per week, with the first harvest ready just 25-30 days from planting.**
