###### The Science & Story Behind It

The development of ‘WS-Lite’ focused on taming the plant's natural vigor for a controlled aquatic environment.
- The restrained, clumping growth is a result of selecting for a specific dwarfing gene that reduces internode elongation and lateral spreading, preventing it from overwhelming the AquaPod system while maintaining high leaf and stem production.
- Its signature hollow stems (aerenchyma) are a natural adaptation for buoyancy and gas exchange in aquatic environments. ‘WS-Lite’ has been bred for a more uniform and robust aerenchyma structure, which contributes to its consistently crisp texture.
- The reduced invasiveness is a critical trait, achieved by selecting for plants with a lower propensity for seed set and a less aggressive rooting system, making it an environmentally responsible choice for contained water cultivation.

In short, **Water Spinach Stem ‘WS-Lite’** is a **well-behaved, crisp, and aqua-optimized** green, a domesticated version of a wild aquatic vegetable that brings the unique texture and flavour of water spinach to the ethical and space-conscious urban gardener.
