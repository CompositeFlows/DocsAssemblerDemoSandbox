###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Tiny Kabu’ offers a surprisingly sweet, nutty, and mild flavour with none of the pungency or bitterness associated with larger turnip varieties. The roots have an incredibly smooth, creamy texture - similar to a crisp apple - and thin, edible skin. The attached greens are tender and mild, resembling delicate mustard greens without the sharpness. The entire plant forms a low, tidy rosette ideal for dense planting.

**2. The Dual-Purpose Delicacy**
This turnip’s greatest virtue is its versatility, with both roots and greens being culinary treasures.
- **Raw and Fresh:** The roots are tender and sweet enough to be eaten raw, sliced thin in salads or served with dip like a radish.
- **Glazed or Roasted:** Whole or halved, they caramelize beautifully when roasted or glazed with miso or honey, becoming even sweeter and more tender.
- **Quick-Pickled:** Their small size and crisp texture make them perfect for quick-pickling, creating a sweet-and-tangy condiment.
- **Sautéed Greens:** The greens can be sautéed with garlic as a nutritious side dish, or used raw in salads when very young.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Tiny Kabu’ matures with remarkable speed. For the best texture, harvest the roots when they are young and firm, typically at 3-4 cm in diameter. Greens can be harvested lightly throughout growth. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a **dense and uniform yield of 6-10 perfectly formed mini-turnips and a substantial bunch of greens, with roots ready for harvest in just 35-40 days from sowing.**
