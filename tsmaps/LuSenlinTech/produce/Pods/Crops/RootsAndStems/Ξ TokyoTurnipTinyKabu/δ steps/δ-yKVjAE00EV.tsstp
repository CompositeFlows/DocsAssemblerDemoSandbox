###### The Science & Story Behind It

The appeal of ‘Tiny Kabu’ stems from its accelerated sugar development and selected biochemical profile for mildness.
- The rapid growth and sweet flavour are due to highly efficient conversion of starches to sugars in the root, combined with a thin, non-fibrous skin that minimizes protective compounds often associated with bitterness.
- Its uniform, round shape results from a controlled root bulking process where the root develops symmetrically without the elongation common in many turnip varieties.
- The hairless, mild greens are a selected trait that reduces oxalic acid content and eliminates the trichomes (small hairs) found on many turnip greens, resulting in a more palatable and tender leaf perfect for fresh eating.

In short, **Tokyo Turnip ‘Tiny Kabu’** is a **fast, sweet, and dual-purpose** delicacy, a refined variety that offers the gourmet appeal of Japanese vegetables in a miniature, balcony-friendly format.
