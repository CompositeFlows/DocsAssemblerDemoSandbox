‘Tiny Kabu’ is a exquisite, miniature Japanese turnip cultivar revered for its buttery-sweet flavour and dual-purpose harvest. This rapid-growing variety produces perfectly round, smooth, snow-white roots no larger than a golf ball, with a texture so tender it can be eaten raw. The plant also produces a generous bunch of delicate, hairless greens, making ‘Tiny Kabu’ a complete vegetable package that delivers two gourmet crops from a single, compact plant.
