‘Neon 5’ is a vibrant, multi-coloured finger carrot bred for speed, beauty, and container-friendly growth. This Nantes-type cultivar produces a stunning, uniform bunch of slender, coreless roots, each plant yielding carrots in a sequenced palette of purple, yellow, red, white, and classic orange. Reaching a petite 10-12 cm in length at maturity, ‘Neon 5’ delivers a full-sized carrot’s sweet, earthy flavour in a miniature, rainbow-hued form that is as productive as it is ornamental.
