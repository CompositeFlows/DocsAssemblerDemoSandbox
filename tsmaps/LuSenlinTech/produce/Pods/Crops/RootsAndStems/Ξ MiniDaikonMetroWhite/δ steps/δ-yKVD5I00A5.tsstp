###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Metro-White’ offers a remarkably mild and sweet radish flavour with only a subtle, clean peppery note, lacking the pungent heat of smaller radishes. The roots are cylindrical, smooth-skinned, and brilliantly white, with a crisp, juicy, and non-fibrous texture. The plant produces a modest crown of lobed green leaves, maintaining a compact above-ground profile.

**2. The Mild, Multi-Purpose Radish**
This mini daikon’s mildness and crisp texture make it incredibly versatile in both raw and cooked preparations.
- **Salads and Sunomono:** Julienned or thinly sliced, it is perfect for fresh salads and Japanese sunomono (vinegared salads), where its crispness and ability to absorb dressing shine.
- **Quick Pickles:** The classic use for daikon, ideal for making tangy, crisp takuan-style quick pickles or Korean kakdugi (cubed radish kimchi).
- **Stir-fries and Soups:** Can be diced or sliced for stir-fries, stews, and miso soup, where it softens slightly while retaining a pleasant texture and adding a mild, sweet note.
- **Garnish and Wrap:** Large, thin shavings can be used as a fresh, edible garnish or as a low-carb wrap for fillings.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Metro-White’ is a relatively fast-maturing daikon for its size. The roots are best harvested young and tender, before they reach maximum girth, to ensure the best texture. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a **uniform yield of 4-6 pristine, cylindrical roots, ready for harvest in approximately 50-55 days from sowing.**
