‘Metro-White’ is a space-optimized, cylindrical daikon radish that condenses the mild, crisp refreshment of its full-sized ancestors into a container-friendly form. This cultivar produces sleek, pure white roots approximately 15 cm long and 3-4 cm in diameter, with a non-tapering, blunt shape ideal for shallow soil pods. Retaining the signature delicate bite and juicy crunch of traditional daikon, ‘Metro-White’ is a versatile Asian staple that brings clean, crisp flavour to the balcony garden.
