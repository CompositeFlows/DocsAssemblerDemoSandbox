###### The Science & Story Behind It

The success of ‘Ruby 2’ is founded on its accelerated sugar development, uniform shape, and reduced geosmin production.
- The rapid development and intense sweetness are due to a highly efficient photosynthesis-to-sucrose conversion pathway in the root, alongside a gene that promotes early and uniform root bulking, preventing the toughness that can occur in slower-growing beets.
- The perfect spherical shape is a result of selecting for a symmetrical root meristem and a thin, delicate taproot, allowing the storage root to form a uniform ball ideal for container growth and consistent cooking times.
- The mild flavour in both roots and greens is achieved by selecting for low geosmin levels and a favourable balance of oxalic acid in the leaves, resulting in a sweeter, less earthy root and a more palatable, tender green.

In short, **Baby Beet ‘Ruby 2’** is a **sweet, dual-purpose, and space-smart** variety, a genetic refinement that offers a rapid, bountiful, and beautiful harvest of roots and greens from the most compact of growing spaces.
