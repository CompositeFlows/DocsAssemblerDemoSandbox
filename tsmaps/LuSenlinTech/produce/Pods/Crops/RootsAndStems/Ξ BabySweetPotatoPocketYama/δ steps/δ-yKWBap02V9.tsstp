###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Pocket Yama’ offers the quintessential sweet potato flavour: a rich, honeyed sweetness with moist, vibrant orange flesh that becomes creamy when cooked. The tubers are small, elongated, and typically 8-12 cm long, with smooth, copper-red skin. The plant itself is a semi-trailing beauty with heart-shaped, purple-tinged leaves that serve as an ornamental ground cover and a source of edible, nutrient-rich greens.

**2. The Personal-Sized Sweet Treasure**
This sweet potato’s perfect individual size and classic flavour make it incredibly versatile.
- **Whole-Roasted Perfection:** Its small size allows it to roast quickly and evenly, becoming caramelized and tender, perfect as a single-serving side dish.
- **Steamed or Boiled:** Ideal for steaming or boiling whole, then mashed or simply split open with a pat of butter.
- **Sweet Potato Fries:** Can be sliced into uniform wedges or rounds for baking into perfect, personal batches of sweet potato fries or chips.
- **Greens Sauté:** The young leaves and shoots are a delicious, nutritious green when sautéed with garlic, similar to spinach but with a heartier texture.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Pocket Yama’ is a mid-season producer that signals harvest time when the vines begin to yellow slightly in the autumn. The compact root system allows the entire plant to be lifted easily from a container. Supplied as an RFID-tagged slip, a single plant provides a **modest but valuable yield of 4-6 small, uniformly-sized tubers, with a total weight of 400-600 grams, ready for harvest approximately 100-110 days after planting.**
