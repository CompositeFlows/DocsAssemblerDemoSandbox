###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Urban Lotus’ delivers the quintessential lotus root flavour: a clean, sweet, and slightly nutty taste with an incomparable watery crunch. The rhizomes are small in diameter (4-6 cm), typically 2-3 segments long, with the characteristic symmetrical holes and thin, pale tan skin. The plant maintains a miniature scale overall, with smaller, elegant pads and flowers that rise just 30-40 cm above the water surface.

**2. The Crisp, Ornamental Delicacy**
This lotus’s primary value lies in its unique texture and beautiful form, making it ideal for both culinary and decorative purposes.
- **Salads and Sunomono:** Sliced paper-thin, it adds a spectacular visual pattern and refreshing crunch to salads and Japanese vinegared dishes (sunomono).
- **Quick Pickles:** Its small size and crisp texture make it perfect for quick-pickling, creating beautiful, patterned slices that retain their firmness.
- **Stir-fries and Tempura:** Can be sliced or cubed for stir-fries, where it stays remarkably crisp, or used in tempura for a delicate, crunchy bite.
- **Edible Garnish:** The distinctive patterned slices make stunning edible garnishes for various dishes, from sushi plates to main courses.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Urban Lotus’ is harvested young, typically 3-4 months after planting, before the rhizomes become large and fibrous. The entire cluster can be lifted from the shallow tray, or individual rhizomes can be carefully broken off. Supplied as an RFID-tagged tuber section for shallow water culture, a single planting provides a **modest but exquisite yield of 3-5 small, perfectly formed young lotus roots, totaling 200-400g of prime, crisp rhizomes.**
