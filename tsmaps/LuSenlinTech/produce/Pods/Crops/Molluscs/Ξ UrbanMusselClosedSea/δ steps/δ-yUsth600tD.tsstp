‘Closed-Sea’ is a revolutionary, fast-filtering strain of blue mussel (*Mytilus edulis*) specifically developed for recirculating urban aquaculture systems. This cultivar thrives in the controlled salinity of a {{tm.haloponicTM}} Salt Loop, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to artificial conditions while maintaining the classic briny-sweet flavor of its ocean-dwelling counterparts. Growing to a perfect bite-sized 3-4 cm, ‘Closed-Sea’ forms dense clusters on suspended ropes or artificial substrates, serving as both an efficient water purifier and a reliable source of premium shellfish.
