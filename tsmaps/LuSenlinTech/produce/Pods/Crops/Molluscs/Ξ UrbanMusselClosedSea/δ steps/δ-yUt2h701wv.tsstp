###### The Science & Story Behind It

The success of ‘Closed-Sea’ lies in its adapted filtration efficiency and reproductive control for closed systems.
- The accelerated growth rate is achieved by selecting strains with highly efficient filter-feeding apparatus and metabolic systems optimized for the consistent, nutrient-rich algal suspensions used in recirculating systems.
- Their adaptability to stable, artificial salinity levels (20-25 ppt) is a result of selective breeding for osmoregulatory efficiency, allowing them to thrive far from natural tidal fluctuations.
- The synchronized growth and reduced spawning frequency are engineered traits that direct energy toward meat production rather than reproductive cycles, ensuring plump, consistent quality year-round.

In short, **Urban Mussel ‘Closed-Sea’** is a **rapid-filtering, space-efficient, and flavor-authentic** cultivar, a cornerstone species for urban marine aquaculture that transforms waste nutrients into gourmet shellfish while purifying the aquatic environment.
