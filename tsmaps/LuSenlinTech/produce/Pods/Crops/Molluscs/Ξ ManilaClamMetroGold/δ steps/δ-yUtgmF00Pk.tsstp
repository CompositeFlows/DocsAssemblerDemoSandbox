###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Metro-Gold’ offers the prized Manila clam flavor: exceptionally sweet and buttery with minimal chewiness and a clean, briny finish. The meat is tender and plump, ranging from creamy beige to subtle orange when cooked. The shells are oval-shaped with distinctive concentric rings and a beautiful golden-brown coloration that makes them stand out from common clams. Their consistent small size ensures even cooking and perfect single-bite portions.

**2. The Sweet, Versatile Bivalve**
This clam's superior sweetness and tender texture make it ideal for both simple and complex preparations where its flavor can shine.
- **Clams in White Wine Sauce:** The premier preparation - steamed quickly with garlic, white wine, and butter until they just open, creating a sublime broth.
- **Pasta alle Vongole:** The classic Italian pasta dish where their sweet flavor and tender texture perfectly complement garlic, olive oil, and parsley.
- **Clam Chowder:** Provides sweet, tender morsels for both creamy New England and clear broth Manhattan-style chowders.
- **Raw on the Half-Shell:** Small, premium specimens can be served raw with a squeeze of lemon or mignonette sauce.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Metro-Gold’ is a rapid-growing, prolific burrower that thrives in 5-10 cm of coarse sand or specialized substrate. They actively filter feed, improving water clarity and quality. In a {{tm.haloponicTM}} substrate bed, a square meter can yield **3-5 kg of premium clams over an 8-10 week cycle, reaching optimal harvest size of 3.5 cm in as little as 7 weeks from juvenile seeding.**
