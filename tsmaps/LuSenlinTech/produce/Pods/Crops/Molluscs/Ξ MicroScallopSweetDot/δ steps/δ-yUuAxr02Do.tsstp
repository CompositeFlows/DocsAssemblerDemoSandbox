###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Sweet-Dot’ offers an extraordinarily sweet, almost candied flavor with distinct hazelnut undertones and a remarkably tender, delicate texture. The adductor muscle is small but perfectly formed, cooking to an opaque white with a buttery softness. The meat has a higher natural sugar content than most bivalves, creating a caramelized exterior when seared. Live specimens display vibrant blue eyespots along the mantle edge and active swimming behavior.

**2. The Delicate Sweet Specialty**
This scallop's intense sweetness and petite size make it ideal for applications where subtlety and rapid cooking are essential.
- **Quick Sear or Ceviche:** The premier preparation - seared for mere seconds to caramelize the natural sugars or "cooked" in citrus juice for ceviche, preserving their delicate texture.
- **Raw Crudo or Sashimi:** Served raw with minimal accompaniments like high-quality olive oil and sea salt to highlight their natural sweetness.
- **Scallop Butter Sauté:** Quickly sautéed in brown butter with fresh herbs, where their small size ensures even cooking and perfect texture.
- **Gourmet Garnish:** Used whole as an elegant garnish for seafood dishes, adding both visual appeal and bursts of sweet flavor.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Sweet-Dot’ is a rapid-growing, active filter feeder that thrives in well-oxygenated water with moderate flow. Their swimming ability helps them maintain optimal positioning for feeding. In a {{tm.haloponicTM}} system with suspended trays, a square meter of growing space can yield **2-3 kg of premium micro scallops over a 10-12 week cycle, reaching harvest size of 3 cm in 9-10 weeks from spat.**
