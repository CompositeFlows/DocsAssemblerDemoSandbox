###### The Science & Story Behind It

The unique qualities of ‘Sweet-Dot’ derive from its specialized metabolism and maintained swimming behavior in captivity.
- The intense sweetness results from selective breeding for scallops with enhanced glycogen storage in the adductor muscle and efficient conversion of filtered nutrients into natural sugars.
- The maintained swimming ability in tank conditions is a rare trait achieved by selecting for individuals with strong jet propulsion mechanics and orientation behavior, making them both functional and fascinating to observe.
- The dwarf size and synchronized growth are controlled by selecting for early reproductive maturity at a small size, redirecting energy from shell growth to meat quality and flavor development.

In short, **Micro Scallop ‘Sweet-Dot’** is a **flavor-intense, behaviorally active, and space-efficient** cultivar, a gourmet specialty that brings the dynamic beauty and exceptional sweetness of scallops to the smallest urban marine systems.
