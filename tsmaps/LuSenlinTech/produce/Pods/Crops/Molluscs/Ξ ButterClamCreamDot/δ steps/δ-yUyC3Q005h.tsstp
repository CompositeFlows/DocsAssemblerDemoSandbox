###### The Science & Story Behind It

The luxurious quality of ‘Cream-Dot’ stems from its unique lipid profile and controlled maturation.
- The exceptional buttery flavor and texture result from selective breeding for clams with higher concentrations of specific lipids and glycogen, creating a naturally richer, more unctuous meat composition.
- The tender, non-rubbery texture is achieved through breeding for a specific collagen structure and muscle fiber density that breaks down more readily during cooking.
- Their synchronized fat deposition during the final growth phase is a selected trait that ensures consistent quality and flavor development across the harvest population.

In short, **Butter Clam ‘Cream-Dot’** is a **flavor-rich, texture-luxurious, and maturation-controlled** cultivar, a specialty bivalve that brings the indulgent, buttery essence of wild butter clams to urban aquaculture with unparalleled consistency and quality.
