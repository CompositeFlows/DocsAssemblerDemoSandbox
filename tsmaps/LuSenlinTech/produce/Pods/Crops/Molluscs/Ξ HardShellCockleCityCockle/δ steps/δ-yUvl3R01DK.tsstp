‘City Cockle’ is a robust, rapidly-filtering strain of common cockle (*Cerastoderma edule*) selected for its exceptional hardiness and consistent growth in urban aquaculture systems. This cultivar develops the classic heart-shaped, heavily ribbed shell in a compact 3-4 cm diameter, with a distinctive white to light brown coloration. Known for its vigorous filtering activity and tolerance to variable conditions, ‘City Cockle’ delivers the sweet, mildly briny flavor and pleasantly chewy texture that makes cockles a staple in coastal cuisines worldwide.
