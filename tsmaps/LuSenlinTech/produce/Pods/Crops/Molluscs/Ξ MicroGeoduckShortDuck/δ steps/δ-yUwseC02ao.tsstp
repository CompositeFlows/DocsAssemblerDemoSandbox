‘Short-Duck’ is a revolutionary dwarf strain of geoduck clam (*Panopea generosa*) that condenses the legendary qualities of its massive ancestor into a compact, urban-friendly format. This cultivar develops the characteristic long, united siphon but reaches a manageable 12-15 cm total length, with a shell proportionally sized at 6-8 cm. Selected for its rapid burrowing and accelerated growth in artificial substrate systems, ‘Short-Duck’ delivers the same astonishingly sweet, clean flavor and crisp-crunchy texture that makes geoduck a prized delicacy, but in a perfectly portioned size.
