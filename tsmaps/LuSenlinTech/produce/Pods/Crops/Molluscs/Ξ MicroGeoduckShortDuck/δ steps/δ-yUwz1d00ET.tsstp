###### The Science & Story Behind It

The innovation of ‘Short-Duck’ represents a breakthrough in bivalve growth regulation and morphology control.
- The truncated siphon length while maintaining texture quality is achieved through selective breeding for early siphon maturation and efficient nutrient partitioning to the edible portions.
- The accelerated growth rate in artificial systems comes from selecting for geoducks with highly efficient filter feeding and siphon extension behavior optimized for constant water flow conditions.
- Their adaptation to shallower burrowing depths is a key urban adaptation, achieved by breeding for animals that thrive in the constrained vertical space of container systems without compromising meat quality.

In short, **Micro Geoduck ‘Short-Duck’** is a **texture-unique, rapidly-maturing, and space-adapted** cultivar, a miniature marvel that brings the legendary crunch and sweetness of geoduck within practical reach of urban aquaculture enthusiasts.
