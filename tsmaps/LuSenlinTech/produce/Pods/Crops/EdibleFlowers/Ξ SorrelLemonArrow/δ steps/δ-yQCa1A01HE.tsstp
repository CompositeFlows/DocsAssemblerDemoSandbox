###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Lemon Arrow’ delivers an intense, pure lemon flavor with a crisp, succulent texture and a clean finish free of metallic aftertaste. The leaves are distinctively arrow-shaped, glossy, and medium green with prominent veining, growing in upright clusters from a central crown. The plant forms a dense, self-supporting mound that remains attractive and productive through multiple seasons.

**2. The Natural Citrus Seasoning**
This sorrel's powerful acidity and bright flavor make it an exceptional finishing herb and flavor enhancer.
- **Soup and Sauce Finisher:** The classic use - finely chopped and stirred into creamy soups, sauces, and pan drippings at the last moment to add instant brightness.
- **Salad Citrus Replacement:** Can replace lemon juice or vinegar in salad dressings when blended into vinaigrettes, providing both acidity and fresh green notes.
- **Fish and Seafood Partner:** A natural companion to fatty fish and seafood, where its acidity cuts through richness perfectly.
- **Compound Butter and Spreads:** Chopped and mixed into butter, cream cheese, or yogurt for instant citrus-herb spreads.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Lemon Arrow’ is a cut-and-come-again perennial that becomes more productive with regular harvesting. Pick individual leaves from the outside of the plant, or cut entire stems 5 cm above the crown. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **consistent yield of 15-25 intensely flavored leaves per week, with harvests possible year-round in protected balcony conditions.**
