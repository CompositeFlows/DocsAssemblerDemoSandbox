‘TriStar’ is a stunning, clump-forming cultivar of purple oxalis bred specifically for container cultivation and culinary use. This ornamental edible features dramatic, triangular deep purple leaves that fold downward at night, accompanied by delicate pale pink flowers. What sets ‘TriStar’ apart is its remarkably balanced oxalic acid content - delivering the bright, tangy "sorrel" flavor without the overwhelming sharpness of wild oxalis species. The plant forms a compact, self-contained mound perfect for balcony gardens.
