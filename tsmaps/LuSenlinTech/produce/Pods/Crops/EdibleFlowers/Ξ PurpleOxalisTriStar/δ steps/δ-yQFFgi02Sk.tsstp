###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘TriStar’ offers a clean, sharp lemon-sorrel flavor with subtle herbal undertones and a crisp, juicy texture. The leaves are triangular, deep burgundy-purple with a lighter central marking, arranged in symmetrical groups of three on slender burgundy stems. The plant grows as a dense, clumping mound 15-20 cm tall and wide, with the characteristic nyctinastic movement (leaf folding) that adds living interest.

**2. The Colorful Tangy Accent**
This oxalis's vibrant color and bright acidity make it ideal for uses where both visual impact and flavor matter.
- **Salad Brightener:** A few leaves scattered through green salads provide dramatic color contrast and a burst of citrusy tang that reduces the need for dressing.
- **Seafood and Avocado Garnish:** The perfect accompaniment to rich foods like salmon, scallops, or avocado toast where its color and acidity balance fat content.
- **Cocktail and Beverage Garnish:** Used as a stunning rim garnish or floated in drinks where it adds both visual appeal and subtle tartness.
- **Dessert Decoration:** The purple leaves and pink flowers create exquisite decorations for cakes and desserts, providing both beauty and a surprising flavor contrast.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘TriStar’ is a moderate but continuous producer when harvested thoughtfully. Pick individual leaves from the outer portion of the plant, taking care not to remove more than one-third of the foliage at once. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **steady yield of 15-25 flavorful leaves per week, with harvests beginning 60 days after planting and continuing year-round in indoor or protected conditions.**
