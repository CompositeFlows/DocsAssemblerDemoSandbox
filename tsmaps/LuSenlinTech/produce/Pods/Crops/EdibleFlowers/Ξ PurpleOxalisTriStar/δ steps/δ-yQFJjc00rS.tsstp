###### The Science & Story Behind It

The culinary success of ‘TriStar’ lies in its balanced oxalate chemistry and stable pigmentation.
- The pleasant, manageable tartness results from selecting for a specific oxalic acid concentration that provides the desirable sorrel-like zing without the mouth-puckering intensity or potential toxicity concerns of wild oxalis species.
- The stable deep purple coloration comes from consistent anthocyanin production in the leaves, maintained through selective breeding for color stability across varying light conditions.
- The compact, non-invasive growth habit is engineered through selection for a clumping rather than running root system, making it well-behaved in container gardens unlike its weedy relatives.

In short, **Purple Oxalis ‘TriStar’** is a **colorful, tangy, and well-mannered** ornamental edible, a domesticated version of a wild plant that brings both striking beauty and reliable citrus-sorrel flavor to the urban gardener's palette.
