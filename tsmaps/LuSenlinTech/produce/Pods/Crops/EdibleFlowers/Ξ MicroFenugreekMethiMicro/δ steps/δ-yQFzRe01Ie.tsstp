###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Methi-Micro’ stems from its accelerated growth cycle and optimized phytochemical profile for the microgreen stage.
- The rapid, uniform growth is achieved through selective breeding for highly efficient cotyledon development and delayed true leaf emergence, extending the optimal harvest window.
- The balanced sweet-bitter flavor results from selecting for specific sotolone compounds (responsible for the maple character) while moderating the more aggressive bitter alkaloids that develop in mature plants.
- The tender texture and vibrant color are maintained through enhanced chlorophyll production and delayed fiber development in the stems and leaves, ensuring perfect texture at microgreen stage.

In short, **Micro Fenugreek ‘Methi-Micro’** is a **rapid-cycling, flavor-concentrated, and space-maximizing** specialty green, a cultivated refinement that delivers the essence of traditional fenugreek in a modern, balcony-friendly microgreen format.
