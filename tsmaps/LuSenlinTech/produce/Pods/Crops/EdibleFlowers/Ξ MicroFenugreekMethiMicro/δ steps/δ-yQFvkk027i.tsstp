###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Methi-Micro’ delivers a sophisticated flavor profile beginning with distinct maple syrup sweetness, followed by subtle celery and bitter notes, and finishing with the characteristic fenugreek aroma. The leaves are small, tender, and divided into three rounded leaflets of bright green. The plants grow as uniform, upright microgreens with delicate stems that remain succulent and crisp at harvest size.

**2. The Sweet-Bitter Flavor Complex**
This microgreen's unique flavor combination makes it exceptionally versatile for both traditional and modern culinary applications.
- **Flatbread and Paratha Topping:** The classic Indian use - sprinkled over dough before cooking to create flavorful *methi paratha* with concentrated fenugreek essence.
- **Grain and Legume Enhancer:** Mixed into rice dishes, dals, and bean salads where its sweet-bitter complexity balances starchy flavors.
- **Salad and Sandwich Accent:** Adds a unique flavor dimension to green salads and sandwiches, providing both sweetness and bitter counterpoints.
- **Garnish with Depth:** Used as a finishing herb on soups, curries, and roasted vegetables where it adds both visual freshness and flavor complexity.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Methi-Micro’ is an ultra-rapid producer, reaching optimal harvest size in just 12-15 days from sowing. Harvest by cutting entire plants just above the soil line with sharp scissors. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides an **exceptionally fast and abundant yield of 90-130g of aromatic microgreens per 10x10 cm area, with successive plantings possible every two weeks throughout the growing season.**
