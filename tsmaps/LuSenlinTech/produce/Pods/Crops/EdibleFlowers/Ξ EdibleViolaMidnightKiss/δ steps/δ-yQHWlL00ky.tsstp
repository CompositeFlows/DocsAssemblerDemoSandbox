###### The Science & Story Behind It

- The intense, stable black-purple coloration results from selecting for maximum anthocyanin concentration with balanced pH expression in the petals, preventing the color fading common in dark violas.
- The complex flavor profile comes from a unique combination of terpenes and phenolic compounds that provide the wintergreen-grape notes while maintaining a sweet, non-bitter finish.
- The compact, free-flowering habit is achieved through breeding for day-length neutrality and enhanced flower bud initiation, creating a plant that blooms persistently without becoming leggy.

In short, **Edible Viola ‘Midnight Kiss’** is a **color-intense, flavor-complex, and space-efficient** ornamental edible, a specialized cultivar that brings dramatic beauty and sophisticated flavor to the urban gardener's palette.
