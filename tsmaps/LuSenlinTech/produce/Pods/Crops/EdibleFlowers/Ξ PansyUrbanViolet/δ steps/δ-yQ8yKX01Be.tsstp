###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Urban-Violet’ offers a subtle, sweet flavor with hints of wintergreen and a soft, lettuce-like texture. The flowers are medium-sized with the characteristic pansy "face" in rich purple and yellow, featuring unusually thick, succulent petals that hold up well in culinary applications. The plant forms a dense, self-cleaning mound of dark green foliage that continuously produces new blooms throughout the season.

**2. The Ultimate Edible Garnish**
This pansy’s primary value lies in its decorative appeal and versatile, mild flavor that complements rather than dominates dishes.
- **Salad and Dessert Topper:** The classic use - whole flowers add instant elegance and a subtle sweetness to green salads, fruit salads, and desserts.
- **Candied Flowers:** Their sturdy petals and sweet base flavor make them ideal for crystallizing with egg white and sugar to create stunning cake decorations.
- **Ice Cube Elegance:** Frozen into ice cubes or ice rings, they transform ordinary beverages into special occasion cocktails and punches.
- **Savory Plate Accent:** Use as edible decorations on cheese boards, appetizer plates, and main courses where their color provides dramatic contrast.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Urban-Violet’ is a day-neutral variety that flowers continuously when harvested regularly. Pick flowers in the morning when they are fully open but still fresh, choosing the newest blooms for the best texture. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **consistent yield of 20-30 perfect flowers per week, with first blooms appearing just 50 days after germination and continuing until frost.**
