‘Urban-Violet’ is a dwarf, high-performance pansy cultivar specifically engineered for continuous bloom and robust flavor in container environments. This compact variety features the classic "face" pattern in deep violet, gold, and maroon, but with thicker petals and a sweeter, milder flavor than traditional garden pansies. Growing in a tidy mound no taller than 15 cm, ‘Urban-Violet’ produces an endless supply of edible flowers perfect for elevating everyday meals into gourmet experiences.
