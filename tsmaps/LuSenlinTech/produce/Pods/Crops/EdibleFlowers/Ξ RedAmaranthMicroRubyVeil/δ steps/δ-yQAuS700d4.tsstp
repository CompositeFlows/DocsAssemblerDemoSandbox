###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Ruby Veil’ stems from its optimized pigment production and accelerated growth cycle.
- The intense, stable red coloration results from high concentrations of betalain pigments (specifically amaranthine) that are maintained throughout growth, unlike some varieties that green up as they mature.
- Its rapid growth and tender texture are achieved through selective breeding for efficient photosynthesis in young leaves and delayed fiber development, allowing harvest at the perfect texture window.
- The enhanced sweetness and reduced oxalate content come from selecting for specific chemotypes that balance flavor compounds, creating a microgreen that is both nutritious and palatable.

In short, **Red Amaranth Micro ‘Ruby Veil’** is a **rapid-cycling, nutrient-dense, and visually stunning** microgreen, a specialized cultivar that delivers maximum color and nutrition in minimum time and space.
