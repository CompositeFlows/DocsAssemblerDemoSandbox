###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Ruby Veil’ offers a delicate, sweet spinach-like flavor with earthy undertones and a hint of beets, completely lacking the bitterness sometimes found in mature amaranth greens. The leaves are tear-shaped, slightly succulent, and display an intense ruby-red color with shimmering, almost iridescent quality. The plant grows as a dense cluster of upright stems, creating a uniform carpet of color perfect for microgreen production.

**2. The Colorful Microgreen Superfood**
This amaranth's dramatic appearance and nutritional profile make it ideal for elevating simple dishes into gourmet creations.
- **Salad and Bowl Topper:** A handful of leaves adds intense color and mild, sweet flavor to grain bowls, salads, and avocado toast.
- **Garnish with Impact:** Use as a vibrant bed for serving seafood, white meats, or cheeses where the red color provides stunning contrast.
- **Smoothie Booster:** Adds powerful antioxidants and a beautiful pink hue to smoothies without altering flavor significantly.
- **Edible Confetti:** Finely chopped and sprinkled over dishes as a colorful, nutritious finishing touch.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Ruby Veil’ is an ultra-rapid microgreen, reaching harvest size in just 14-18 days from sowing. Harvest by cutting entire plants just above the soil line with clean scissors. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides an **exceptionally quick and abundant yield of 80-120g of vibrant microgreens per 10x10 cm area, with multiple successive plantings possible throughout the season.**
