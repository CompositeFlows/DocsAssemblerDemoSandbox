‘Chop-Chop’ is a rapid-cycling, compact cultivar of garland chrysanthemum specifically bred for high-density container production and continuous harvest. This dwarf variety delivers the signature aromatic, herbaceous flavor of shungiku with a more refined bitterness and tender texture than traditional types. Growing in a dense, bushy habit just 20-25 cm tall, ‘Chop-Chop’ is engineered for quick regrowth after cutting, making it the ultimate cut-and-come-again green for Asian-inspired balcony cuisine.
