###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Ruby Vine’ offers a mild, slightly citrusy spinach flavor with hints of pepper and a remarkably succulent, mucilaginous texture that thickens soups and stews. The leaves are thick, heart-shaped, and dark green with striking red veining, while the stems and vines are a vibrant ruby red. The plant exhibits a controlled vining habit, producing lateral branches that create a dense, productive screen.

**2. The Heat-Loving Spinach Substitute**
This vine's unique texture and heat tolerance make it invaluable for summer cooking when traditional spinach fails.
- **Stir-fries and Sautés:** The premier use - quick-cooked with garlic and oil where its mucilaginous quality helps create rich, clinging sauces.
- **Summer Soups and Stews:** Added during the final minutes of cooking to provide thickening power and nutrient density without turning slimy.
- **Raw in Salads:** Young leaves and stem tips can be used fresh in salads, providing a juicy crunch and mild flavor.
- **Ornamental Edible Screen:** Grown vertically to create a beautiful, productive privacy screen that thrives in the hottest balcony spots.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Ruby Vine’ is a continuous producer throughout the hottest months. Harvest individual leaves and tender stem tips regularly to encourage branching. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **substantial yield of 150-200g of leaves and tips per week throughout summer, with first harvests possible 50 days after planting.**
