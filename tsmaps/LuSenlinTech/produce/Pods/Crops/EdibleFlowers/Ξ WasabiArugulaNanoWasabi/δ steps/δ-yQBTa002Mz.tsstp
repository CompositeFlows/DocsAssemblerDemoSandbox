###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Nano-Wasabi’ delivers an immediate, clean, sharp heat that rises through the nasal passages - the characteristic sensation of true wasabi - followed by the familiar peppery, nutty finish of quality arugula. The leaves are small, rounded, and deep emerald green with a slightly thicker, succulent texture than standard arugula. The plant grows as a dense, uniform rosette that remains compact and productive.

**2. The Instant Wasabi Alternative**
This arugula's unique heat profile makes it invaluable for dishes where true wasabi is desired but impractical.
- **Sushi and Sashimi Companion:** The premier use - a few fresh leaves provide the authentic wasabi experience alongside raw fish, eliminating the need for processed wasabi paste.
- **Salad Heat Element:** Adds a surprising, clean heat to salads and slaws that is fundamentally different from chili pepper heat.
- **Sandwich and Wrap Accent:** A single leaf can replace mustard or wasabi spread in sandwiches, providing immediate flavor impact.
- **Garnish with Punch:** Use as a final garnish on soups, noodles, or rice bowls where the nasal-clearing heat will complement rather than overwhelm.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Nano-Wasabi’ is a cut-and-come-again variety that becomes more potent as it matures. Harvest outer leaves when they reach 5-7 cm in diameter for continuous production. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **consistent yield of 20-30 pungent leaves per week, with first harvest possible just 25 days after germination.**
