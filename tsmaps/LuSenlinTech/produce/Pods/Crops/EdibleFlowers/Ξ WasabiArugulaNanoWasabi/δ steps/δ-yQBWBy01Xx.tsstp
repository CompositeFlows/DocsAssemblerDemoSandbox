###### The Science & Story Behind It

The breakthrough of ‘Nano-Wasabi’ lies in its unique glucosinolate profile and compact growth genetics.
- The authentic wasabi heat is achieved through selective breeding for specific glucosinolates that break down into isothiocyanates similar to those in true wasabi (*Wasabia japonica*), rather than the different isothiocyanates found in regular arugula.
- The compact, uniform habit results from a dwarfing gene that limits vertical growth while promoting leaf density, creating a plant that maximizes leaf production in minimal space.
- The stable heat profile is maintained through selection for consistent enzyme activity that ensures the conversion of glucosinolates to active isothiocyanates occurs reliably upon leaf damage (chewing or cutting).

In short, **Wasabi Arugula ‘Nano-Wasabi’** is a **space-efficient, heat-authentic, and rapid-cycling** specialty green, a culinary innovation that brings the coveted wasabi experience within easy reach of every urban gardener.
