###### The Science & Story Behind It

The development of ‘Citrus Wheel’ represents a breakthrough in flavor enhancement and growth habit modification for edible flowers.
- The compact, mounding habit is achieved through selective breeding for a specific dwarfing gene that suppresses the vining tendency typical of nasturtiums while maintaining high leaf and flower production density.
- The unique citrus flavor profile results from enhanced production of limonene and citral compounds alongside the traditional glucosinolates that provide the peppery notes, creating a balanced, complex flavor that is less harsh than wild varieties.
- Its continuous flowering capability is engineered through day-length neutrality and reduced sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, allowing consistent production regardless of seasonal changes on the balcony.

In short, **Nasturtium ‘Citrus Wheel’** is a **compact, citrus-infused, and perpetually productive** edible flower, a genetic innovation that transforms the traditional nasturtium into a space-efficient, flavor-forward specialty crop for the urban gourmet.
