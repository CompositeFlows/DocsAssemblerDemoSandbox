###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Citrus Wheel’ offers a complex flavor profile beginning with the classic watercress-like pepperiness of traditional nasturtiums, followed by a bright, clean citrus finish that distinguishes it from all other varieties. The leaves are nearly circular, variegated with subtle cream veining, and grow in dense rosettes. The flowers appear as semi-double blooms in shades of tangerine, lemon-yellow, and apricot, with the same peppery-citrus flavor as the foliage.

**2. The Dual-Purpose Pepper-Citrus Accent**
This nasturtium’s unique flavor combination and compact form make it exceptionally versatile for modern culinary applications.
- **Signature Salad Mix:** The leaves and flowers create a stunning, flavorful base for salads, providing both visual appeal and a peppery-citrus punch that reduces the need for additional dressing.
- **Gourmet Garnish:** Whole flowers and individual leaves make elegant, edible garnishes for appetizers, seafood dishes, and desserts where their citrus notes complement rather than overwhelm.
- **Compound Butters & Spreads:** Finely chopped leaves and petals mixed into butter or cream cheese create vibrant, flavorful spreads for canapés and sandwiches.
- **Quick-Pickled Buds:** The unopened flower buds can be quick-pickled as a sustainable "poor man's caper" alternative with a unique citrus-pepper character.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Citrus Wheel’ is a continuous producer designed for frequent harvesting. The more you pick, the more it produces. Harvest leaves individually from the outer portion of the plant, and flowers when they are fully open but still fresh. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **consistent yield of 15-25 edible leaves and 8-12 flowers per week, with harvest beginning just 35 days after germination.**
