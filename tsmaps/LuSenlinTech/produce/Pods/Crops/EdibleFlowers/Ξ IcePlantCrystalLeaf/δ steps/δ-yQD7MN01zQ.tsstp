###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Crystal Leaf’ delivers a unique and complex flavor: a natural salinity reminiscent of the ocean, followed by a mild, crisp acidity and a clean, watery crunch. The leaves are small, cylindrical, and densely packed with shimmering epidermal bladder cells that create a crystalline appearance. The plant forms a tight, spreading mat just 10-15 cm tall, with occasional daisy-like magenta flowers.

**2. The Natural Saline Accent**
This ice plant's unique texture and inherent saltiness make it invaluable for modern culinary applications where it can replace both greens and seasoning.
- **Salad Texture Specialist:** The premier use - added raw to salads where its salty crunch provides both seasoning and textural contrast to other greens.
- **Seafood and Sashimi Bed:** A natural companion to raw fish and seafood, serving as an edible "seabed" that enhances oceanic flavors without additional salt.
- **Ceviche and Tartare Mix-in:** Chopped and mixed into ceviche, tartares, and crudos where its salinity and crunch complement raw proteins.
- **Cocktail Rim Alternative:** The sparkling leaves can be used to rim cocktail glasses instead of salt, adding visual drama and subtle salinity.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Crystal Leaf’ is a continuous producer that responds well to frequent, light harvesting. Snip individual leaf clusters or give the entire plant a "haircut" 2-3 cm above the soil. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **steady yield of 30-50g of crystalline leaves per week, with first harvests possible 40 days after planting and continuous production year-round in protected environments.**
