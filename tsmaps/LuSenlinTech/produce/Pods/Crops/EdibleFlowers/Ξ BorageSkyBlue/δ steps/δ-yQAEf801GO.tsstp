###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Sky-Blue’ offers an intense, clean cucumber flavor with subtle sweet and mineral notes. The flowers are the signature true blue, star-shaped blooms that maintain their vibrant color, while the leaves are smaller, more tender, and less bristly than standard borage. The plant forms a dense, rounded mound 25-30 cm in height and spread, with multiple branching stems that keep the iconic flowers displayed prominently.

**2. The Refreshing Cucumber Accent**
This borage's vibrant color and crisp flavor make it exceptionally versatile for both culinary and beverage applications.
- **Signature Cocktail Garnish:** The ultimate use - floating a single star-shaped flower in summer drinks, lemonades, or gin and tonics for stunning visual appeal and subtle cucumber essence.
- **Salads and Desserts:** Scattered over green salads, fruit salads, or light desserts to add bursts of color and refreshing flavor.
- **Flower Ice Cubes:** Frozen into ice cubes or rings to transform ordinary beverages into extraordinary presentations.
- **Young Leaf Salads:** The youngest, most tender leaves can be finely chopped and added to salads for a cucumber flavor boost without the texture of mature leaves.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Sky-Blue’ is a continuous producer when harvested regularly. Pick flowers daily as they open, choosing the freshest blooms for optimal color and flavor. Young leaves can be harvested sparingly. Supplied as a pre-seeded {{tm.rFIDSeedPadCartridges}}, it provides a **steady yield of 20-30 perfect blue flowers per week, with first blooms appearing just 60 days after germination and continuing until frost.**
