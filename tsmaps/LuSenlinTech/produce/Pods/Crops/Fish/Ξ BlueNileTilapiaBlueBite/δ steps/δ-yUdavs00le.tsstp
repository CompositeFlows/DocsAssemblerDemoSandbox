###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘BlueBite’ offers a sweet, clean flavor with a notably firm, large-flake texture that holds up exceptionally well to various cooking methods. The flesh is pearly white with a slightly translucent quality when raw, cooking up to a bright white with excellent structural integrity. The fish has a streamlined, muscular build with striking blue-gray coloration and iridescent scales that catch the light.

**2. The Firm, Versatile Performer**
This tilapia's robust texture and sweet flavor make it ideal for cooking methods that would cause more delicate fish to fall apart.
- **Grilling and Barbecuing:** Its firm flesh readily holds onto grill grates without sticking or breaking, developing excellent sear marks and a smoky flavor.
- **Soups and Stews:** Maintains its structure beautifully in brothy dishes, not disintegrating even with prolonged simmering.
- **Pan-Frying and Sautéing:** Develops a crisp exterior while the interior remains moist and flaky, perfect for fish sandwiches or as a standalone entrée.
- **Baking and Roasting:** Can be roasted whole or as thick filets without drying out, making it excellent for herb-crusted preparations.

**3. The Growth & Harvest Cycle**
‘BlueBite’ maintains active feeding and growth at temperatures as low as 18°C (64°F), extending the productive season for outdoor systems. It efficiently converts feed even during spring and autumn temperature dips. Reared in a {{tm.bioFlocTM}} system, a cohort provides a **reliable harvest of 10-14 fish per 100-liter barrel, reaching optimal plate size of 220-280 grams in 5-6 months, with better winter survival rates than standard tilapia strains.**
