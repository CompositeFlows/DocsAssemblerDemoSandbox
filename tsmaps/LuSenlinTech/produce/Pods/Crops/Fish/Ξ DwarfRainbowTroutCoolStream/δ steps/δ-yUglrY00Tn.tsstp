‘CoolStream’ is a cold-water adapted, dwarf strain of rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) engineered for viability in compact, chilled recirculating systems. This cultivar delivers the iconic flavor profile of stream-fed trout - a clean, nutty sweetness with a tender, pink-tinged flake - in a fish that reaches a perfect portion size of 200-280 grams. Selected for its ability to thrive in colder water temperatures (10-16°C) and its calm demeanor in high-density tanks, ‘CoolStream’ brings the taste of a mountain stream to the urban balcony.
