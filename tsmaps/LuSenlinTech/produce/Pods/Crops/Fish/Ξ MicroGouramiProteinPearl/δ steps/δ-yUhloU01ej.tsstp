‘Protein Pearl’ is a dwarf, labyrinth-breathing gourami (*Trichogaster lalius*) strain developed for ultra-high-density micro-aquaculture in minimal water volumes. This cultivar combines the hardiness and air-breathing capability of its family with a surprisingly rapid growth rate and efficient feed conversion for its size. Reaching a delicate harvest weight of just 40-60 grams, ‘Protein Pearl’ produces sweet, tender morsels of white flesh, making it the ultimate choice for niche protein production and decorative aquaponics in the most space-constrained urban settings.
