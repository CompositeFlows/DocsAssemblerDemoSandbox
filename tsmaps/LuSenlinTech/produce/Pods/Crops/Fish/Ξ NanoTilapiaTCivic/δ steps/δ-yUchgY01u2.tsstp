###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘T-Civic’ offers a exceptionally clean, mild, and subtly sweet flavor with a firm, yet delicate flake and virtually no "fishy" aftertaste. The flesh is bright white and remains consistently firm even when cooked with high heat. Its small, uniform size and low oil content make it a versatile culinary canvas. The fish itself is compact and deep-bodied, with a silvery-gray coloration and minimal dark meat lining the lateral line.

**2. The Ultimate Urban Whitefish**
This tilapia’s neutral profile and perfect portion size make it the ideal candidate for a vast array of global cuisines and cooking methods.
- **Pan-Seared or Grilled:** The premier preparation - the small filets cook quickly and evenly, developing a beautiful golden crust while the interior stays moist and flaky.
- **Tacos and Ceviche:** Its firm texture holds up beautifully in acidic marinades for ceviche or when grilled and flaked for fish tacos.
- **Steaming and En Papillote:** A top choice for gentle cooking methods that highlight its delicate sweetness, often paired with ginger, scallions, and light soy.
- **Fish Cakes and Burgers:** Its low fat and firm flake bind well, creating excellent fish cakes, burgers, or croquettes that are not greasy.

**3. The Growth & Harvest Cycle**
‘T-Civic’ exhibits a rapid, efficient growth curve optimized for constant water conditions. It thrives on a balanced, plant-based diet that ensures clean flavor from harvest to plate. Reared in a {{tm.bioFlocTM}} system, a cohort provides a **steady, staggered harvest, yielding 8-12 perfect single-serving fish per 100-liter barrel over a 5-month cycle, reaching optimal harvest size of 200g in just 4-5 months from fry.**
