‘Edible-3’ is a fast-cycling, schooling barb species (*Hypsibarbus malcolmi*) developed for high-density aquaponics and rapid harvest turnover. This cultivar combines the vibrant golden-orange coloration of ornamental barbs with a surprisingly substantial body depth and efficient growth rate. Reaching a sleek harvest size of 120-180 grams, ‘Edible-3’ forms tight, shimmering schools that are both visually mesmerizing and highly efficient at converting feed into clean, flavorful flesh, offering a smaller-plate alternative to larger urban fish species.
