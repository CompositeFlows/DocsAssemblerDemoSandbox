###### The Science & Story Behind It

The development of ‘Pocket Stripe’ focused on stabilizing its ornamental traits alongside its culinary quality in a compact form.
- The dwarfism and synchronized growth are controlled by selecting for a specific growth hormone receptor variant that causes the fish to plateau at a small size, ensuring all fish in a cohort reach harvestability simultaneously.
- The prominent "pocket stripe" is a stabilized ornamental trait linked to melanocyte distribution genes. This selective breeding also indirectly enhanced skin integrity, resulting in a more resilient fish less prone to handling stress and skin infections.
- The consistent, sweet flavor is a product of controlled diet and selective breeding against the genes that allow accumulation of geosmin and MIB from the environment, guaranteeing a clean-tasting product regardless of the system's microbial balance.

In short, **Mini Channel Catfish ‘Pocket Stripe’** is a **visually distinct, flavor-mild, and growth-synchronized** cultivar, a refined version of an American classic that brings reliable harvests and aesthetic appeal to the clear-water urban aquaculture system.
