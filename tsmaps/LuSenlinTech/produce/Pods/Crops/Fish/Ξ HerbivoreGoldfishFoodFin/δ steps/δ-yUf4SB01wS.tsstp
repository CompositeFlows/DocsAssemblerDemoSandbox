‘FoodFin’ is a specialized, sterile triploid strain of common goldfish (*Carassius auratus*) developed exclusively for sustainable biomass production in integrated aquaponics systems. This cultivar bypasses the ornamental selection of its relatives, instead favoring rapid growth, efficient plant-based feed conversion, and a robust constitution. Reaching an optimal harvest size of 200-300 grams, ‘FoodFin’ presents a unique culinary profile - milder than carp and more substantive than most small aquaculture species - making it a versatile, sustainable protein source for the urban ecosystem.
