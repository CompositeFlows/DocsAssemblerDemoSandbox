‘Silver Byte’ is a sterile, fast-growing dwarf strain of common carp (*Cyprinus carpio*) engineered for efficient biomass production in high-density urban systems. This cultivar bypasses the typical bottom-feeding behavior and muddy flavor associations of its wild relatives, instead favoring a suspended, mid-water feeding habit that results in exceptionally clean, mild flesh. Reaching an optimal harvest size of 160-220 grams, ‘Silver Byte’ displays a brilliant, uniform silver scale pattern and a deep-bodied form, delivering a versatile whitefish protein with surprising delicacy.
