‘Quick-Koi’ is a patented, fast-maturing Nishikigoi (*Cyprinus rubrofuscus*) strain developed exclusively for the culinary market, decoupling the traditional koi from its ornamental lifecycle and immense size. This cultivar stabilizes the most vibrant color patterns - Kohaku (red-on-white), Sanke (red-and-black-on-white), and Shusui (blue scaleless) - but selects for a genetic trigger that halts growth at a perfect 180-gram plate size. ‘Quick-Koi’ delivers a rich, flavorful flesh with a texture closer to wild carp than to pond-raised ornamental fish, making it a visually stunning and culinary unique offering.
