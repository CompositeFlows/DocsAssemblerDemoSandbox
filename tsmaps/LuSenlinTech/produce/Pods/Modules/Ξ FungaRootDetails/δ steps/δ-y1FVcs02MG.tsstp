##### How It Works

###### 1. The Starter Plug

{{el.luSenLinName}}’s nursery cultivates young Finger Carrots, Baby Beets, Tokyo Turnips, and Baby Kohlrabi in a sterile substrate, pre-inoculated with spores or vegetative mycelium of edible truffle species (e.g., *Tuber melanosporum* or the faster-fruiting *Tuber borchii*).
This specific selection is ideal because these roots thrive in the well-drained, aerated medium that truffles require. Their varied root structures provide a large, diverse surface area for the mycelium to colonize, creating a robust symbiotic network.

###### 2. Symbiosis in the Module

Once the plug is inserted into the FungaRoot module, {{tm.harvestSageTM}} maintains the precise environmental conditions to trigger truffle formation:
- A high pH (7.5–8.0)
- A stable temperature of ~18 °C
- Alternating moist and brief-dry cycles
These conditions encourage the fungus to form a mycorrhizal mantle around the roots. Over approximately 14 weeks, the roots develop for harvest while the truffle mycelium simultaneously produces small fruiting bodies (mini "button" truffles, 1–2 cm in size).

###### 3. The Dual Harvest

When the door light turns green, you pull out the drawer to collect both crops:
- Harvest the mature Finger Carrots, Baby Beets, Tokyo Turnips, and Baby Kohlrabi.
- Pick the attached truffle nuggets from the root system and surrounding substrate.
The average yield from the 500 mm cube module is **450 g of assorted root vegetables plus 30–40 g of fresh truffle per cycle.**
