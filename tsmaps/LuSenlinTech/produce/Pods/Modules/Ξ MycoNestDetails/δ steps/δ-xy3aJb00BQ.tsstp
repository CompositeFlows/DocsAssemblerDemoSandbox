##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Mycology research has precisely identified the environmental shifts - specifically a drop in CO₂ and a spike in humidity and oxygen - that signal to the mycelium that it is time to produce fruiting bodies to spread its spores.
- Contamination is the primary challenge in mushroom cultivation; the combination of pre-sterilised blocks and in-situ UV-C sterilisation creates a clean-room environment that eliminates competitors.
- The separation of the colonization phase (done off-site in a lab) from the fruiting phase (in the module) drastically simplifies the process for the user and guarantees success.

In short, the MycoNest is a **myco-precise fruiting environment** that uses atmospheric science and sterile technique to reliably transform compact blocks into abundant, clean harvests of gourmet and functional mushrooms.
