##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The morphology of aquaculture tanks and the flow dynamics within them have a profound impact on fish welfare, affecting stress levels, muscle development, and waste dispersion.
- Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) represent the pinnacle of sustainable fish farming, recycling over 99% of the water by using mechanical and biological filtration; this system brings that technology to a domestic scale.
- By allowing the environment to be programmed for specific species, the system acknowledges that one habitat does not fit all, optimizing welfare and yield simultaneously.

In short, the FinWave is a **programmable aquatic habitat** that uses advanced hydrodynamics and closed-loop science to provide a pristine, species-specific environment, turning a compact tank into a reliable source of the freshest, healthiest fish.
