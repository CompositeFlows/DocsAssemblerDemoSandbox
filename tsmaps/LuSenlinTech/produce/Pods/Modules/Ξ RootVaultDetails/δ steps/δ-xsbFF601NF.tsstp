##### How It Works

###### 1. The Pre-Germinated Plug
{{el.luSenLinName}}’s nursery supplies pre-germinated plugs, giving each delicate taproot a perfect, undisturbed start. This selection - from the deep-reaching **Finger Carrot ‘Neon 5’** to the crisp, swollen stem of **Baby Kohlrabi** - is ideal because these varieties respond directly to soil moisture profiles, driving their roots to seek water and develop ideal shape and size.

###### 2. Hydro-Guided Formation in the Module
Once the plugs are seated at the top of the RootVault column, {{tm.harvestSageTM}} initiates a specialized root-bulking program:
- The **{{tm.moistureGradientAeratedColumns}}** create a precise environment: the top layer remains dry and aerated, while the base is consistently moist. This forces taproots like those on **Baby Beet ‘Ruby 2’** and **Radish ‘Flash-40’** to drive downward aggressively and straighten in their search for water, completely eliminating forkintm.
- The loose, soilless coco-perlite medium provides zero resistance, allowing roots to expand freely without becoming misshapen.
- For stem vegetables like **Compact Celery**, the consistent moisture ensures steady, crunchy growth without stringiness.

###### 3. The Clean-Slide Harvest
The RootVault transforms harvesting from a chore into a clean, effortless reveal.
- When the **{{tm.harvestReadyGreenDoorLight}}** glows, indicating peak size and sugar content, the harvest sequence begins.
- The **{{tm.sideEjectDrawer}}** is engaged, sliding the entire root column out horizontally. This avoids any compaction or breakage that can occur from pulling vertically.
- The clean, dry medium allows you to simply lift out unblemished, restaurant-quality roots. There is no dirt, no mess, and no damage.
- The system yields **a full column of perfect roots per 6-8 week cycle, typically 400-500g of market-ready produce.**
