##### How It Works

###### 1. The Pre-Rooted Cutting
{{el.luSenLinName}}’s nursery supplies pre-rooted cuttings or young plants, selected for their genetic potential for sturdy stem development. This specific selection - **Compact Celery**, **Water Spinach Stem**, and **Baby Kohlrabi** - is ideal because these crops directly translocate water and nutrients from their roots to their stems, making them highly responsive to the targeted irrigation this system provides.

###### 2. Differential Irrigation in the Module
Once the plants are seated in the StemStack, {{tm.harvestSageTM}} initiates a specialized stem-bulking program:
- The **{{tm.dualZoneMoistureProfile}}** creates two distinct environments: a mid-layer mist humidifies the emerging stems to encourage thick, succulent cell growth, while a timed, brief flood at the base delivers a concentrated burst of nutrients directly to the roots.
- This "hydric exercise" - alternating between high humidity and a flood of nutrients - forces the stems of **Compact Celery** and **Water Spinach** to thicken for superior crunch, while simultaneously encouraging the **Baby Kohlrabi** to swell its edible bulb uniformly.
- The system ensures stems remain rigid and full of water without becoming waterlogged or fibrous.

###### 3. The Crisp-Stem Harvest
The StemStack signals when the stems have reached peak texture and size.
- The **{{tm.harvestReadyGreenDoorLight}}** illuminates when biomass and internal turgor pressure sensors confirm the stems are at their crispest.
- For **Celery** and **Water Spinach**, the **{{tm.cutAndComeAgainOpticalMapping}}** system can guide the harvest of outer stalks, allowing the plant core to continue producintm.
- The entire **Baby Kohlrabi** bulb is harvested at the base when mature.
- The system provides a **continuous yield of 300–500g of ultra-crisp stems and bulbs per module per 8-week cycle.**
