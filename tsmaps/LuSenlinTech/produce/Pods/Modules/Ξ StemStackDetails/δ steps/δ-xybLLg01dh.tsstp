##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The physical properties of celery and similar stems (known as petioles) are directly governed by water pressure (turgor) within their cells. The mid-level misting maintains this pressure at a maximum, preventing the stringiness that occurs with inconsistent water uptake.
- Plants can develop different root structures in response to moisture gradients; this system exploits that plasticity to create a root zone optimized for both nutrient uptake (in the flooded zone) and oxygen absorption (in the aerated mid-zone).
- By treating the stem and the root zone as two interconnected but distinct systems, it becomes possible to engineer for a specific textural outcome in the harvested product - maximizing crunch.

In short, the StemStack is a **texture-optimizing hydroponic system** that uses targeted hydrology to forge the crispest, most succulent stems imaginable, delivering a satisfying crunch that is rarely achieved outside of perfect field conditions.
