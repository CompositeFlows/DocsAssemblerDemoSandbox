Compact, stackable, and energy-efficient, our systems run on integrated solar panels or small batteries. We prioritize edible produce inspired by global cuisines - from Beijing’s fresh herbs for hotpots to Tokyo’s shiitake for ramen, Paris’s escargot, or New York’s fusion salads with microgreens and seafood. All products are non-GMO, responsibly sourced, and meet international biosafety standards.
