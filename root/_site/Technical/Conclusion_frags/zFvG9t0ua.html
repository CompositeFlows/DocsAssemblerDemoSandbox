<h1 id="what-you-just-experienced">What You Just Experienced</h1>

<p>As you configured the garden, you experienced something that traditional documentation cannot offer: a single guide that seamlessly adapted to your choices, yet was built from reusable, always-accurate components.</p>

<p>Behind that simple interaction were principles that change documentation forever:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It Was Built to Last.</strong> The guide wasn’t a fragile, static document. It was a living system, assembled from blocks of knowledge. Changing a single block - a plant’s spacing requirement, a module’s specification - updates every guide that uses it, instantly and without error.</li>
  <li><strong>It Was Effortless to Follow.</strong> The path felt natural, like a conversation. But unlike a chat with an AI, every piece of advice was grounded in verifiable, authoritative knowledge, with no risk of hallucination.</li>
  <li><strong>It Scales Without Breaking.</strong> What you saw was a garden, but the same system can effortlessly manage the endless variables of a crisis, a complex product, or an entire organisation’s procedures. The complexity is handled behind the scenes, while the user receives only the clarity they need.</li>
  <li><strong>It is text.</strong> In your own git repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the shift: from writing documents that are hard to keep accurate, to building a knowledge system that is inherently consistent, clear, and maintainable.</p>
