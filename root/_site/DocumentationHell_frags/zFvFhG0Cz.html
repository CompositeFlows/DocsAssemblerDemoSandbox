<h5 id="what-are-decision-trees">What are Decision Trees?</h5>

<p>A decision tree is a classic tool for mapping choices - a flowchart that starts with a single “root” question and branches out into every possible outcome. For simple, binary choices (“Is the printer on?”), they provide a clear, logical path.</p>

<h5 id="the-unspoken-reason-they-fail">The Unspoken Reason They Fail</h5>

<p>For decades, decision trees have been the obvious theoretical solution for capturing complex processes. Their failure in practice has is exponential complexity.</p>

<p>Adding just a few real-world variables - user roles, error states, environmental conditions - causes their branches to explode. Ten yes/no questions can generate over a thousand paths. For anything resembling real operational knowledge, they become monstrous, un-auditable, and utterly unmaintainable.</p>

<p>This isn’t a minor inconvenience; it’s the fundamental bottleneck that has prevented us from properly documenting complex, branching expertise. The ability to truly conquer this complexity would open up a powerful new way to build, maintain, and leverage knowledge in any field.</p>
