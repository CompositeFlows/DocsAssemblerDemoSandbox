<p>Consider a large software platform, like a cloud service or a video editing suite. Its long-term success depends on a single critical factor: maintainability - the ability to modify, update, and fix it with minimal effort, cost, and risk.</p>

<p>A highly maintainable system is like a well-organised workshop: any tool is easy to find, and adding a new one is simple. A system with poor maintainability is a tangled pile of cables, making every change a high-stakes gamble you wish you could avoid.</p>

<p>The key to ease of upkeep is the <strong>Single Source of Truth</strong> principle. Instead of duplicating code, you define a component - e.g., a class, method, or constant - in one place and reuse it everywhere. Change it once, and the update propagates across the entire system instantly.</p>

<p>In short, maintainability is about building for change. It’s the difference between creating a fragile monument that crumbles at the first edit and creating a resilient, living system that evolves effortlessly with your needs.</p>
