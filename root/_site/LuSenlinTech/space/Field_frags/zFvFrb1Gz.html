<p>A field installation represents the pinnacle of scalable, decentralized food production. This is not a standard kit, but a turnkey agricultural facility designed and built to your specifications.</p>

<p>Transforming an open field into a high-yield vertical farming operation is a significant engineering project. It involves civil works, high-capacity utility connections, large-scale climate control, and complex logistics.</p>

<p><strong>For projects of this scale, the process begins with a consultation.</strong> Please contact our industrial projects team to discuss your vision, goals, and site specifics. Based on this, <strong>Lǜ Sēnlín</strong> will undertake a comprehensive feasibility study and create a detailed master plan, treating your project with the same rigor as a factory installation.</p>
