<h2 id="garden">Garden</h2>

<p>A private garden offers the ideal foundation for a high-yield vertical farming system, with ample space for expansion and natural light.</p>

<p>To fully leverage your garden’s potential, we begin with a complimentary aerial and topographic drone survey. This provides a data-driven blueprint to design a perfectly integrated and resilient food production ecosystem.</p>

<p>The survey will analyze:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sunlight &amp; Shadow Mapping:</strong> Creating a full-season model of light patterns to position towers for maximum photosynthetic yield.</li>
  <li><strong>Topography &amp; Drainage:</strong> Modeling the land’s contours to ensure optimal water management and prevent pooling.</li>
  <li><strong>Zoning &amp; Workflow:</strong> Planning the layout for efficient harvesting, maintenance paths, and aesthetic harmony with your outdoor space.</li>
</ul>

<p>This comprehensive analysis allows us to design a system where your <strong>PrecisionHeat™</strong> root zones and irrigation schedules are perfectly calibrated to your specific climate. If your system requires off-grid power, the data will also determine the optimal size and placement for a <strong>HotCarrier™</strong> solar array.</p>
