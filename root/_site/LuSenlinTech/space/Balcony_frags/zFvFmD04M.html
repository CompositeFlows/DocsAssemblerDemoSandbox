<h2 id="tiny-patio-or-balcony">Tiny Patio or Balcony</h2>

<p>A Tiny Patio or Balcony is a perfect space for a productive vertical garden.</p>

<p>Because your garden will be placed outdoors, we offer a complimentary aerial drone survey of your location. This isn’t just about measuring space; it’s about capturing precise environmental data to optimize your garden’s performance.</p>

<p>The survey will analyze:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sunlight Exposure:</strong> Tracking the sun’s path to calculate the exact daily light integral (DLI) your plants will receive.</li>
  <li><strong>Micro-Climate Mapping:</strong> Identifying potential wind tunnels, frost pockets, or heat sinks specific to your balcony.</li>
  <li><strong>Structural Planning:</strong> Ensuring the ideal placement for both plant health and your enjoyment of the space.</li>
</ul>

<p>This data allows us to fine-tune the schedule of your <strong>PrecisionHeat™</strong> system and other climate controls, guaranteeing your garden thrives in its unique environment. If your system requires off-grid power, this survey will also determine the optimal tilt and placement for <strong>HotCarrier™</strong> solar panels.</p>
