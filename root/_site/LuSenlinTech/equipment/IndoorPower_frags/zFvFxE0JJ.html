<p>To ensure reliable operation for your tower’s climate control, lighting, and automation, we need to understand your power situation. Please note: if a grid connection isn’t available, your Frame Tower will be configured with a <strong>SolisCell™</strong> power module, providing energy independence for all core systems.</p>
