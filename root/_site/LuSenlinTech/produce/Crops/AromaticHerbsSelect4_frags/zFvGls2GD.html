<p>Because culinary herbs are typically harvested in small, high-flavour portions, the Herb 〈¦‹modelName›¦〉 Module is subdivided into 〈¦‹bayCount›¦〉 bays. Plant one herb across all bays for bulk harvests or mix up to 8 different herbs for a living spice rack.</p>

<p>All herbs are bred for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>≤ 25cm mature height.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fast regrowth after cutting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High essential-oil concentration for maximum aroma in small harvests.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
