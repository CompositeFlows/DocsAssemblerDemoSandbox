<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The development of ‘Ruby Drift’ focused on enhancing anthocyanin production and improving leaf cell structure for a superior eating experience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The stable, deep red pigmentation is achieved by selecting for a high and consistent expression of anthocyanin genes (specifically for cyanidin) in the leaf tissues, which is triggered by sunlight. The green base ensures the plant remains highly efficient at photosynthesis, supporting its rapid growth.</li>
  <li>Its exceptional tenderness is a result of selecting for leaves with a thin cuticle and a high water content within the leaf cells. The cell walls are also more flexible, giving the leaf its characteristic soft, “buttery” mouthfeel without any fibrous toughness.</li>
  <li>Unlike some red lettuces that can become tough or bitter in an effort to produce protective pigments, ‘Ruby Drift’ has been bred to maintain a favourable balance between antioxidant production (anthocyanins) and the genes responsible for sweetness and tender leaf development.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Red Leaf Lettuce ‘Ruby Drift’</strong> is a <strong>vivid, velvety, and visually arresting</strong> green, a cultivar that masters the art of combining stunning aesthetics with a classic, sweet, and exceptionally tender eating quality.</p>
