<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is a lesson in efficient plant architecture:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The upright, columnar growth habit is known as an “erectophile” canopy, a trait selected to maximize light penetration to lower leaves in dense plantings. This is the same principle used in modern field crops to increase yield.</li>
  <li>Its exceptional crispness comes from a high internal turgor pressure and a specific composition of structural polysaccharides in its cell walls, allowing the leaves to snap cleanly rather than bend.</li>
  <li>Unlike its sprawling ancestors, ‘Skyline’ has been bred for a shortened, strengthened stem (core) and leaves that grow at a more acute angle, a genetic trait that prevents it from splaying out and wasting horizontal space in a confined balcony planter.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Skyline Romaine</strong> is a <strong>vertical column of crunch</strong>, a space-efficient reimagining of a classic salad green that delivers the perfect structural integrity and refreshing sweetness for both raw and cooked applications, all from a minimalist footprint.</p>
