<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Skyline Romaine’ offers the quintessential romaine profile: a sweet, nutty flavour with a supremely crisp and refreshing crunch. Its leaves are sturdy yet succulent, with prominent white midribs packed with water for exceptional juiciness. The plant forms a tight, self-wrapping column approximately 20-25 cm tall, resembling a miniature cos lettuce.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-ultimate-crisp-vessel">2. The Ultimate Crisp Vessel</h6>
<p>This lettuce’s structure and mild sweetness make it incredibly versatile.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Perfect Caesar Vessel:</strong> Its sturdy, cup-shaped leaves are the ideal size and strength for individual Caesar salad cups or as edible serving vessels for taco fillings and grain salads.</li>
  <li><strong>Grilled Lettuce:</strong> Its compact, firm heart holds together perfectly when halved and grilled, developing a delicious smoky-sweet char while retaining a cool, crisp interior.</li>
  <li><strong>Sandwiches &amp; Wraps:</strong> Provides a superior crunch and structural integrity for wraps and sandwiches without the wateriness of softer lettuces.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a single-heading variety. For a continuous harvest, outer leaves can be picked, but the classic method is a full harvest by cutting the entire head at the base. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>yield of one dense, 180–220g head approximately 45 days from planting.</strong></p>
