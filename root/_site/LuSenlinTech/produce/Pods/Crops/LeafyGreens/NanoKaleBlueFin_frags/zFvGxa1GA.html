<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘BlueFin’ offers the signature Lacinato kale profile: a deep, earthy, and slightly sweet flavour with peppery undertones, often described as more robust and complex than curly kale. Its leaves are long, narrow, and puckered with a stunning blue-green hue and a surprisingly tender, less fibrous texture than full-sized varieties.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-tender-tough-supergreen">2. The Tender-Tough Supergreen</h6>
<p>This kale’s tender texture and complex flavour make it uniquely versatile.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Salad Raw &amp; Massaged:</strong> Young leaves are tender enough for raw salads. A quick massage with dressing breaks down the cell structure perfectly, eliminating toughness without wilting it into oblivion.</li>
  <li><strong>Soups &amp; Sautés:</strong> The classic choice for Italian <em>Ribollita</em> soup and quick sautés with garlic and chili. Its robust flavour holds up beautifully to cooking.</li>
  <li><strong>Kale Chips:</strong> Its flat, structured leaves are ideal for making baked kale chips, yielding a crispy, savoury snack with an unparalleled depth of flavour.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant forms a compact, upright rosette. Harvest is a ‘cut-and-come-again’ process; carefully removing the lower, outer leaves encourages continuous production from the central crown. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous yield of 40–60g of tender, blue-green leaves per week for months.</strong></p>
