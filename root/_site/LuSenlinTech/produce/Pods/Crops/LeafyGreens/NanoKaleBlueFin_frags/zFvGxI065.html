<p>This is a dwarf, ornamental, and nutritional powerhouse, a Lacinato (or “Dinosaur”) kale cultivar bred for a compact, vase-shaped habit. ‘BlueFin’ delivers the deeply savoury, almost mineral-rich flavour of its towering ancestors, with leaves so tender they can be eaten raw, all from a plant whose sculptural form is as beautiful as it is productive.</p>
