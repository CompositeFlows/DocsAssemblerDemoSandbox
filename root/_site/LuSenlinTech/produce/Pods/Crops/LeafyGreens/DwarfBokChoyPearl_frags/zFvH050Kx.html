<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Pearl’ offers the quintessential bok choy profile: a mild, sweet, and slightly peppery flavour with a clean, refreshing finish. Its appeal lies in its texture contrast - the crunchy, juicy, celery-like stalks (petioles) and the soft, velvety green leaves. The plant forms a perfect, compact cup-shaped head, typically 10-15 cm tall.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-versatile-asian-green">2. The Versatile Asian Green</h6>
<p>This miniature bok choy is incredibly adaptable to various cooking methods.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stir-Fry &amp; Steam:</strong> The premier use. Its small size means it cooks quickly and evenly, becoming tender-crisp. A classic in garlic stir-fries and a perfect vehicle for oyster sauce.</li>
  <li><strong>Soups &amp; Broths:</strong> Adds substance, texture, and gentle sweetness to clear broths, ramen, and hot pots. The stems remain slightly crisp while the leaves wilt delicately.</li>
  <li><strong>Roasted or Grilled:</strong> Halved or quartered, it can be roasted or grilled, developing a delicious caramelized sweetness on the stems while the leaves become crispy.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a fast-growing, single-heading variety. For a continuous harvest, outer leaves can be picked, but the classic method is a full harvest by cutting the entire head at the base. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>rapid yield of one perfect, 80–120g head approximately 30-35 days from planting.</strong></p>
