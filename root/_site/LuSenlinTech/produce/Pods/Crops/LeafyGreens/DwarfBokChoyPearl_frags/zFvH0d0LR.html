<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is a masterpiece of efficient plant morphology:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sweet, non-bitter flavour is a result of a low concentration of glucosinolates that produce sharp, pungent flavours in other brassicas like mustard greens. This makes it one of the most approachable and universally liked Asian greens.</li>
  <li>Its compact, self-wrapping habit is due to a shortened stem (core) and petioles (stalks) that grow in a tightly overlapping, upright fashion. This is a selected trait that prevents the plant from splaying open, protecting the delicate inner heart and maximizing space efficiency.</li>
  <li>The stark colour contrast between the white stems and dark green leaves is a sign of high nutrient diversity. The white stems are packed with water and fibre, while the dark green leaves are rich in chlorophyll, vitamins A and C, and calcium.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Dwarf Bok-Choy ‘Pearl’</strong> is a <strong>perfectly proportioned textural duo</strong>, a rapid-growing miniature that delivers the complete sweet, crunchy, and tender bok choy experience in a single, beautiful, and personal-sized package.</p>
