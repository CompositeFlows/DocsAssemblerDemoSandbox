<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The development of ‘Fringe’ focused on refining leaf morphology and balancing flavour compounds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “fringed” phenotype is the result of selecting for plants with a specific expression of genes controlling leaf margin dissection. This resulted in a more open, lacier leaf structure that maximizes light penetration to the lower leaves and increases the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which concentrates flavours and allows for faster growth.</li>
  <li>Its refined, less aggressive peppery taste comes from a carefully managed glucosinolate profile. While all mizuna contains these sulphur compounds (which give brassicas their bite), ‘Fringe’ has been bred for a lower concentration of the harsher glucosinolates and a higher level of those that provide a smoother, more complex mustardy note.</li>
  <li>Its remarkable tenderness is due to a reduction in lignin deposition in the leaf veins and petioles, ensuring every part of the frond is palatable and delicate, even as the plant matures.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Mizuna ‘Fringe’</strong> is a <strong>lacey, peppery, and perpetually productive</strong> green, a masterclass in breeding for both aesthetic form and culinary function, delivering a continuous supply of elegant foliage to grace your plate.</p>
