<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Fringe’ presents a complex flavour profile: it begins with a mild, grassy-green note that quickly unfolds into a gentle, peppery zest, finishing with a subtle, nutty sweetness. The leaves are incredibly delicate and lacy, forming a dense, fountain-like rosette that is as much an ornamental accent as a culinary workhorse. Its texture is tender yet crisp, providing a delightful mouthfeel.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Garnish and Salad Architect</strong>
This mizuna’s value lies in its ability to elevate any dish with both flavour and form.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Signature Salads:</strong> Its feathery leaves add unparalleled visual texture and a mild peppery note to mesclun mixes. It is the star in a dedicated Japanese-inspired salad with a citrus-soy dressing.</li>
  <li><strong>Garnish with Purpose:</strong> Far more than a pretty leaf, a sprinkle of ‘Fringe’ over soups, grilled fish, roasted meats, or taco bowls adds a burst of fresh flavour and a sophisticated look.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick Wilting &amp; Stir-fries:</strong> While delicate, it can be quickly wilted into soups, ramen, and stir-fries during the final seconds of cooking, adding a layer of peppery depth without becoming slimy.</li>
  <li><strong>Edible Plate Lining:</strong> Use whole rosettes or large sprigs as a beautiful, edible bed for serving appetizers or sushi.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Fringe’ is a prolific cut-and-come-again champion. Harvest by snipping individual leaves 2-3 cm from the base, or give the entire plant a “haircut” by cutting across the rosette about 5 cm above the soil line. It will vigorously regrow. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>consistent and generous yield of 20–40g of delicate foliage per week, with the first harvest ready in as little as 21 days from germination.</strong></p>
