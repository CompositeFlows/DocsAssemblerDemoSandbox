<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>This cultivar represents a perfect bridge between two botanical families:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Komatsuna is a unique brassica (<em>Brassica rapa</em> perviridis) that has been selected over centuries for low levels of pungent glucosinolates, resulting in its characteristic mildness compared to its mustard and turnip cousins.</li>
  <li>Its “Metro-Spin” name highlights its urban adaptability and its role as a superior spinach alternative. Unlike true spinach (<em>Spinacia oleracea</em>), which can bolt quickly in warm weather, Komatsuna is highly bolt-resistant, ensuring a long harvest window on a sunny balcony.</li>
  <li>The leaves are nutritional powerhouses, exceptionally high in calcium and vitamin C. Their sturdy cell structure, derived from their brassica genetics, means they retain more of these nutrients after cooking than more delicate spinach leaves would.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Komatsuna ‘Metro-Spin’</strong> is a <strong>bolt-resistant brassica with a spinach’s soul</strong>, a prolific and forgiving green that provides a continuous, generous harvest of mild, versatile leaves that won’t disappoint in either a quick stir-fry or a delicate salad.</p>
