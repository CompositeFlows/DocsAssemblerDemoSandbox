<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Metro-Spin’ offers a remarkably balanced flavour profile - mildly sweet with the faintest peppery undertone, completely lacking the bitterness or sharpness of many other brassicas. Its leaves are large, oval, dark green, and remarkably succulent with a tender-crisp texture that holds up better to cooking than true spinach. The plant forms an upright, open rosette.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate All-Purpose Cooking Green</strong>
This green’s unique combination of mild flavour and sturdy texture makes it a true kitchen workhorse.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A Superior Spinach Substitute:</strong> Use it anywhere you would use spinach - in sautés, quiches, curries, and creamy soups. It wilts beautifully but retains more structure and doesn’t become slimy.</li>
  <li><strong>Stir-fries &amp; Noodle Dishes:</strong> A staple in Japanese cuisine, it adds volume, nutrition, and a gentle flavour to stir-fries, ramen, and udon dishes.</li>
  <li><strong>Fresh in Salads:</strong> Young leaves are tender and mild enough for fresh salads, while mature leaves can be lightly steamed or blanched for salads where more texture is desired.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
The plant is a prolific, cut-and-come-again variety. Harvest the outer, mature leaves individually by cutting them at the base, allowing the central crown to continuously produce new growth. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous and generous yield of 50–80g of sturdy leaves per week for an extended period.</strong></p>
