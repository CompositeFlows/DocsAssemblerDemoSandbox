<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>This cultivar is a study in cellular structure and leaf morphology:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The signature “buttery” texture is a result of a very thin leaf epidermis (skin) and a high water content held within large, thin-walled cells. These cells rupture with minimal pressure, creating that melting sensation, unlike the rigid, crunchy cells of romaine or iceberg.</li>
  <li>Its sweet flavour and lack of bitterness are linked to a low concentration of sesquiterpene lactones, the compounds responsible for the sharp, bitter notes in many wild and cultivated greens like endive and escarole.</li>
  <li>The loose, open head form is a natural adaptation for preventing moisture and rot in the heart of the plant, a trait that has been selectively maintained and enhanced to create this specific, desirable texture and appearance.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Butterhead Lettuce ‘Silk-Butter’</strong> is a <strong>leaf of pure delicacy</strong>, a cultivar that prioritizes a sublime, melting texture and a gentle sweetness, offering a truly luxurious salad experience from a surprisingly easy-to-grow plant.</p>
