<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Hydro-Pepper’ offers a bold, clean, and pungent flavour profile: an initial sharp, peppery kick reminiscent of radish, followed by a fresh, green, and slightly tangy finish. Its leaves are small, round, and dark green, growing on succulent, hollow stems that are exceptionally crisp and juicy. The entire plant forms a low, spreading mat of vibrant, glossy greenery.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Crisp, Peppery Accent</strong>
This watercress’s intense flavour and refreshing crunch make it a powerful culinary accent.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Salad Spark:</strong> A small handful will electrify a green salad, potato salad, or grain bowl with its pungent spice. It pairs brilliantly with sweet and rich ingredients like oranges, beets, and goat cheese.</li>
  <li><strong>Sandwich &amp; Taco Topper:</strong> The crisp stems and spicy leaves add a fantastic textural and flavourful crunch to sandwiches, burgers, and tacos, cutting through richness with its clean heat.</li>
  <li><strong>Signature Soups:</strong> It is the essential, non-negotiable ingredient for a classic, creamy watercress soup, where its peppery flavour mellows into a deep, complex warmth.</li>
  <li><strong>Garnish with a Kick:</strong> Use as a vibrant, edible garnish on soups, deviled eggs, or grilled fish to add a burst of fresh pepperiness.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Hydro-Pepper’ is a prolific cut-and-come-again variety. Harvest by snipping stems 3-5 cm above the base, using the “haircut” method. It will rapidly produce new shoots from the leaf nodes below the cut. Supplied as an RFID seed pad designed for a self-watering reservoir, it provides a <strong>rapid and abundant yield of 40–60g of crisp stems and leaves per week, thriving in the consistently moist conditions it loves.</strong></p>
