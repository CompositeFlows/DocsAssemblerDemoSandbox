<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>This cultivar is a masterclass in efficient growth and natural hardiness:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its remarkably fast growth cycle is a result of selective breeding for rapid leaf initiation and expansion, allowing it to quickly form a photosynthetic canopy and outcompete weeds - a trait perfectly suited for successive planting in a balcony farm.</li>
  <li>The dark green colour indicates a high chlorophyll content, and as a brassica, it is also rich in glucosinolates, compounds being studied for their potential health-promoting properties when converted to isothiocyanates during chewing or chopping.</li>
  <li>Its distinctive flat, ground-hugging growth habit is a natural adaptation for survival, protecting the vital growing point from pests and harsh weather. This very trait also makes it an ideal “living mulch” that suppresses weeds in a mixed planting.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Tatsoi ‘Sprint’</strong> is a <strong>resilient, rapid-producing flavour bomb</strong>, a robust and versatile green that delivers a continuous, fast harvest of peppery, succulent leaves, making it one of the most productive and reliable plants for the urban gardener.</p>
