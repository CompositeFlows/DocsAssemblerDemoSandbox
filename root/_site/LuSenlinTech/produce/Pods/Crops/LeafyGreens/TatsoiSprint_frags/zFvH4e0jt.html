<p>This is a rapid-growing, compact rosette of spoon-shaped leaves, a cultivar prized for its resilience and unique flavour. ‘Sprint’ lives up to its name, producing a dense, dark green canopy of succulent leaves with remarkable speed, offering a robust, mustard-spinach flavour that stands up beautifully to both quick cooking and raw applications.</p>
