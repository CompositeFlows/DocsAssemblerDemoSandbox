<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The distinction of ‘Lactea Urban’ lies in its enhanced shell composition and refined texture development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pure white, semi-translucent shell results from selective breeding for specific calcium carbonate crystallization patterns and reduced pigmentation, creating both visual appeal and a slightly thinner, more delicate shell structure.</li>
  <li>The exceptionally tender texture is achieved through breeding for a unique muscle fiber composition with lower collagen content, resulting in a melt-in-the-mouth quality when properly prepared.</li>
  <li>Their sensitivity to environmental conditions, while requiring more careful cultivation, ensures that only the highest-quality specimens reach harvest, guaranteeing a premium product.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Milk Snail ‘Lactea Urban’</strong> is a <strong>texture-delicate, flavor-subtle, and visually-elegant</strong> cultivar, a specialty snail that brings a touch of refined sophistication to urban heliciculture, perfect for the discerning chef seeking the ultimate in delicate snail cuisine.</p>
