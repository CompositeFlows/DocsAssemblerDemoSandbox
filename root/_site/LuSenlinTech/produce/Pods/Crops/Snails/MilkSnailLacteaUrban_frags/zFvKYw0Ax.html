<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Lactea Urban’ offers a remarkably clean, mild flavor with subtle mineral notes and a hint of fresh greens. The texture is exceptionally tender - almost delicate - with none of the chewiness found in larger snail species. The meat is pale, nearly translucent when raw, cooking to a soft, yielding consistency. The shells are the standout feature: porcelain-white with a semi-translucent quality that gives them an ethereal, milky appearance.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Delicate, Elegant Specialty</strong>
This snail’s subtle flavor and tender texture make it ideal for applications where delicacy and presentation are paramount.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Raw Snail Crudo:</strong> The premier preparation - sliced paper-thin and served raw with high-quality olive oil, sea salt, and micro-herbs to highlight its natural delicacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightly Poached in Broth:</strong> Gently poached in a delicate vegetable or chicken broth, preserving their tender texture and mild flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>White Wine and Herb Steaming:</strong> Steamed briefly with white wine and fresh herbs, creating a light, aromatic dish where the snail’s subtlety can shine.</li>
  <li><strong>Salad and Canapé Garnish:</strong> Provides elegant, bite-sized morsels for composed salads or as a sophisticated topping for canapés.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Lactea Urban’ thrives in stable, moderate conditions and is particularly sensitive to water quality and diet, requiring clean greens and calcium sources. They grow at a steady, moderate pace. In a carefully maintained Haloponic™, a colony provides a <strong>refined yield of 100-150 pristine snails per month, reaching optimal delicacy and size of 2.5 cm in 9-11 weeks from hatching.</strong></p>
