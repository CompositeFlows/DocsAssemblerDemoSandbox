<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The dual excellence of ‘Neri-Snack’ lies in its enhanced pigmentation and optimized grazing efficiency.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The intense, stable striping results from selective breeding for maximum pigment expression in the periostracum layer, creating both ornamental value and a marker of overall health and shell integrity.</li>
  <li>The concentrated sweet flavor develops from their efficient conversion of diverse algal films into glycogen and flavor compounds, enhanced by breeding for optimal nutrient partitioning.</li>
  <li>Their inability to reproduce in pure seawater while maintaining vigorous grazing activity makes them ideal for controlled urban systems where population management is essential.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Striped Nerite ‘Neri-Snack’</strong> is a <strong>visually-striking, flavor-concentrated, and ecologically-safe</strong> cultivar, the perfect fusion of form and function that brings both impeccable aquarium maintenance and gourmet garnishes to urban marine aquaculture.</p>
