<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Neri-Snack’ offers an intensely sweet, clean marine flavor with subtle mineral notes and a firm, satisfying crunch. The meat is small but powerfully flavored, concentrating the essence of the ocean in a single bite. The texture is crisp yet tender - similar to a high-quality tiny clam. The shells are the standout feature: glossy with dramatic, alternating black and golden-yellow stripes that remain vibrant even after cooking, creating stunning visual appeal.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Edible Garnish</strong>
This nerite’s brilliant appearance and concentrated flavor make it ideal for applications where visual impact and flavor punctuation are paramount.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Live Garnish for Oyster Platters:</strong> The premier use - placed live on ice alongside oysters, then consumed as a palate-cleansing bite between shellfish varieties.</li>
  <li><strong>Soup and Broth Finisher:</strong> Added whole to clear consommés and bisques just before serving, where they provide both visual drama and bursts of sweet flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Sushi and Sashimi Accent:</strong> Used as an elegant, edible decoration on sushi platters or as a tiny nigiri topping.</li>
  <li><strong>Crudo and Ceviche Component:</strong> Their small size and sweet flavor make them perfect for raw preparations, requiring no cutting or preparation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Neri-Snack’ is a constant, efficient grazer that thrives in stable marine conditions. They reproduce in brackish water but grow best in full seawater, making them non-invasive in closed systems. In a Haloponic™ marine setup, a colony provides a <strong>continuous yield of 300-500 pristine snails per month from a 15-liter volume, reaching optimal size and flavor concentration of 1.8 cm in just 5-7 weeks while maintaining impeccable tank cleanliness.</strong></p>
