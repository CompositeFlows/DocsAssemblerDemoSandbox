<p>‘Chef-Shell’ is a revolutionary miniaturized strain of the Giant African Land Snail (<em>Lissachatina fulica</em>) that captures the substantial meat yield of its famous ancestor in a manageable urban format. This cultivar develops the characteristic pointed, striped shell but reaches a compact 5-7 cm length - approximately one-third the size of wild specimens - while maintaining the same impressive meat-to-shell ratio. Selected for rapid growth and mild, versatile flavor, ‘Chef-Shell’ delivers substantial, firm portions ideal for main courses and innovative culinary applications.</p>
