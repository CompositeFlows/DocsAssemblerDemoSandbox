<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Chef-Shell’ offers a clean, mildly earthy flavor with a firm, meaty texture often compared to calamari or mushroom caps. The foot meat is substantial and resilient, holding up well to various cooking methods without becoming tough. The shells display the classic tiger-stripe pattern of brown and tan bands, providing an attractive presentation while being large enough for elegant stuffing and serving.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Substantial Main-Course Snail</strong>
This snail’s generous meat portion and firm texture make it suitable for applications where snail is the centerpiece rather than just a garnish.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Snail Steaks and Medallions:</strong> The premier preparation - sliced into thick medallions and pan-seared or grilled, developing a beautiful crust while remaining tender inside.</li>
  <li><strong>Stuffed Snail Shells:</strong> The shells are large enough to stuff with seasoned snail meat, breadcrumbs, and herbs, then baked until golden.</li>
  <li><strong>Snail Kebabs:</strong> Cubed and threaded onto skewers with vegetables, perfect for grilling with bold marinades.</li>
  <li><strong>Snail “Scaloppine”:</strong> Pounded thin and prepared in the style of veal scaloppine, with lemon, white wine, and capers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Chef-Shell’ grows with remarkable speed, reaching its genetically determined maximum size efficiently. They thrive in warm, humid conditions and consume large quantities of leafy greens and vegetables. In a climate-controlled Haloponic™, a colony provides a <strong>substantial yield of 40-60 main-course sized snails per month, reaching optimal harvest size of 6 cm in 10-12 weeks from hatching.</strong></p>
