<p>‘Peri-Pocket’ is a hardy, fast-grazing strain of common periwinkle (<em>Littorina littorea</em>) adapted for marine haloponic systems. This cultivar develops the classic dark, conical spiral shell but at a compact 1.5-2 cm height, perfect for high-density cultivation. Thriving in artificial seawater conditions, ‘Peri-Pocket’ tirelessly grazes on biofilm and microalgae while developing the intense, briny-sweet flavor that has made periwinkles a coastal delicacy for centuries, delivering authentic ocean taste to inland urban environments.</p>
