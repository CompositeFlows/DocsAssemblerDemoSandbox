<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Peri-Pocket’ offers the quintessential periwinkle profile: an intense burst of clean ocean brine followed by a surprising sweetness and subtle mineral notes. The meat is small but flavorful, with a firm, slightly springy texture that provides a satisfying chew. The shells are dark gray to black with fine spiral ridges, and their small size makes them ideal for single-bite consumption. When cooked, they release a fragrant, oceanic aroma that evokes seaside harvests.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Briny Ocean Bite</strong>
This periwinkle’s intense flavor and petite size make it perfect for simple preparations that highlight its authentic marine character.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Traditional Boiled with Vinegar:</strong> The classic preparation - briefly boiled and served with malt vinegar for dipping, using a pin to extract the meat.</li>
  <li><strong>Periwinkle Salad:</strong> Mixed with other seafood in light, acidic salads where their briny pop complements milder ingredients.</li>
  <li><strong>Seafood Broths and Chowders:</strong> Adds deep oceanic flavor to broths and bisques, often added in the shell for maximum flavor extraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Garlic and White Wine Sauté:</strong> Quickly sautéed with garlic, white wine, and parsley for a sophisticated appetizer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Peri-Pocket’ is an active, constant grazer that thrives on surfaces where biofilm and algae accumulate. They are remarkably tolerant of salinity fluctuations and reproduce readily in stable conditions. In a Haloponic™ marine system, a square meter of grazing surface can yield <strong>500-700 harvest-ready periwinkles per month, reaching optimal flavor and size of 1.8 cm in just 6-8 weeks from juvenile stage.</strong></p>
