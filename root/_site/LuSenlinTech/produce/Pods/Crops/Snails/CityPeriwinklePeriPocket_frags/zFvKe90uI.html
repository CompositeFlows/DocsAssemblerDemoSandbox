<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The success of ‘Peri-Pocket’ lies in its environmental resilience and flavor concentration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The intense flavor concentration results from selective breeding for efficient mineral uptake from seawater and optimal conversion of algal diets into the signature briny-sweet taste compounds.</li>
  <li>Their tolerance to artificial seawater conditions is achieved through selecting for individuals with robust osmoregulatory systems that handle the stable salinity of recirculating systems better than wild counterparts.</li>
  <li>The compact size and rapid maturation are bred traits that allow for high-density culture while maintaining the authentic flavor profile of larger, wild periwinkles.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>City Periwinkle ‘Peri-Pocket’</strong> is a <strong>flavor-intense, space-efficient, and remarkably hardy</strong> cultivar, bringing the authentic taste of the rocky shoreline to urban haloponic systems with reliable production and minimal space requirements.</p>
