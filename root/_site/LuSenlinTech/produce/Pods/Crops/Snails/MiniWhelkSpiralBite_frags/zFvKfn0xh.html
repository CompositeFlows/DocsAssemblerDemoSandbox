<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Spiral Bite’ offers a robust, complex flavor often described as a cross between conch and clam - sweet and briny with distinct umami depth and a hint of iodine. The meat is firm and substantial with a satisfying chew, yet tender enough for quick cooking methods. The shells are beautifully spiraled with brown and white banding, and their compact size makes them perfect for individual servings. The operculum (trap door) is a striking dark brown, adding to their visual appeal.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Substantial Marine Morsel</strong>
This whelk’s firm texture and rich flavor make it suitable for both traditional and innovative preparations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Whelk Salad:</strong> The classic preparation - boiled briefly, sliced, and marinated in a zesty vinaigrette with celery and herbs.</li>
  <li><strong>Sautéed in Garlic Butter:</strong> Quickly sautéed with garlic, white wine, and parsley to enhance its natural sweetness.</li>
  <li><strong>Tempura-Fried:</strong> Lightly battered and fried, creating a crisp exterior that contrasts with the chewy interior.</li>
  <li><strong>Seafood Stews and Paella:</strong> Adds depth and texture to hearty seafood dishes, holding its shape well during cooking.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Spiral Bite’ thrives in brackish water (15-25 ppt salinity) and actively scavenges for organic waste in IMTA systems. They grow steadily while helping maintain system cleanliness. In a brackish Haloponic™ setup integrated with fish culture, a square meter of substrate can yield <strong>200-300 harvest-ready whelks per month, reaching optimal size of 3.5 cm in 10-12 weeks from juvenile stage.</strong></p>
