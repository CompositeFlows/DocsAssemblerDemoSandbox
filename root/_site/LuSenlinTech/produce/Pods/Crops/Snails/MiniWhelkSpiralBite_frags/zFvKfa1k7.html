<p>‘Spiral Bite’ is a compact, carnivorous strain of common whelk (<em>Buccinum undatum</em>) engineered for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) in brackish urban systems. This cultivar develops the characteristic spiral shell with deep siphonal canal, but at a miniature 3-4 cm length, making it ideal for container cultivation. Thriving in brackish conditions where freshwater and marine systems meet, ‘Spiral Bite’ serves as a valuable cleanup crew by consuming detritus and leftover feed, while developing a rich, complex flavor prized in seafood cuisine.</p>
