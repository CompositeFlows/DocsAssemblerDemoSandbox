<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Stalk-Short’ offers a concentrated celery flavor: robust, herbaceous, and slightly salty with a clean, aromatic finish. The stalks are slender, solid, and exceptionally crisp, with a tender texture that lacks the tough strings of conventional celery. The plant grows in a compact, upright fountain of pale golden-green stalks with delicate, flavorful leaves, creating a beautiful, edible ornamental cluster.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Aromatic Flavor Concentrate</strong>
This celery’s intense flavor and tender texture make it ideal for both raw applications and as a foundational flavoring agent.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fresh Snacking and Salads:</strong> The tender, stringless stalks are perfect for fresh eating with dips or diced into salads, where their robust flavor stands out.</li>
  <li><strong>Essential Flavor Base:</strong> A premier choice for the classic <em>mirepoix</em> or <em>soffritto</em>, providing concentrated celery essence to soups, stews, and sauces without bitterness.</li>
  <li><strong>Juices and Smoothies:</strong> Adds a powerful, clean celery flavor to green juices and smoothies, delivering maximum nutrition in minimal volume.</li>
  <li><strong>Leafy Herb Substitute:</strong> The flavorful, delicate leaves can be used as a herb garnish or chopped into salads, similar to parsley but with distinct celery notes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Stalk-Short’ is a cut-and-come-again variety that allows for continuous harvest. Individual outer stalks can be cut at the base as needed, or the entire plant can be harvested at once. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>steady yield of 8-12 slender, crisp stalks over the season, with first harvests possible 70-75 days from transplant.</strong></p>
