<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Neon 5’ offers the quintessential sweet and earthy flavour of a premium Nantes carrot, with a crisp, snappy texture and no woody core. The roots are slender, perfectly cylindrical, and grow in a stunning array of colours: Deep Purple skin with an orange core, Sunshine Yellow, Crimson Red, Lunar White, and Classic Orange. The foliage is a manageable, lacy green tuft, ideal for dense planting in shallow soil volumes.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Colourful Crunch</strong>
This carrot’s visual drama and classic flavour make it incredibly versatile for fresh and lightly cooked applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rainbow Crudité &amp; Snacking:</strong> The ultimate show-stopping vegetable platter centerpiece. Each colour offers a slightly different phytonutrient profile and a visually stunning, sweet crunch for fresh eating.</li>
  <li><strong>Vibrant Salads &amp; Slaws:</strong> Shaved, grated, or spiralized to add a burst of colour and sweet, earthy flavour to salads and slaws. The different colours retain their hues when raw.</li>
  <li><strong>Roasted Medleys:</strong> Tossed whole with olive oil and herbs, they roast quickly, caramelizing their natural sugars while creating a beautiful, multi-coloured side dish.</li>
  <li><strong>Pickled Jewels:</strong> Their small size and firm texture make them perfect for pickling, creating a vibrant and tasty refrigerator pickle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Neon 5’ is a rapid-maturing, uniform cultivar. The entire bunch can be harvested in one go, typically by gently loosening the soil and pulling the entire plant. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a <strong>dense and colourful yield of 8-12 petite, coreless roots per cluster, ready for harvest in a remarkably fast 50-55 days from sowing.</strong></p>
