<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘WS-Lite’ offers a clean, mildly sweet and nutty flavour with a pleasing, succulent crunch from its hollow stems. The stems are crisp, juicy, and pale green, growing to a manageable 20-25 cm length, while the leaves are tender and dark green. The plant grows in a more upright, clumping form compared to traditional varieties, with a restrained root system ideal for aquatic inserts.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Stir-Fry and Soup Specialist</strong>
This green’s unique texture and mild flavour make it a star in quick-cooked dishes, particularly in Southeast Asian cuisine.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stir-fries (<em>Kangkong Belacan</em>):</strong> The premier use; the hollow stems and leaves cook quickly, absorbing savory sauces like fermented shrimp paste (<em>belacan</em>) or garlic and soy while retaining a delightful crunch.</li>
  <li><strong>Soups and Noodle Dishes:</strong> Adds a fresh, green element and tender-crisp texture to broths, ramen, and <em>laksa</em>, wilting perfectly in hot liquid.</li>
  <li><strong>Blanched Salads:</strong> Can be briefly blanched and dressed with sesame oil, oyster sauce, and fried shallots for a simple, classic side dish.</li>
  <li><strong>Fresh Spring Rolls:</strong> The tender leaves and young stems can be used as a fresh, crisp component in Vietnamese spring rolls (<em>gỏi cuốn</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘WS-Lite’ is a rapid-growing, cut-and-come-again aquatic green. Harvest by snipping stems 5-7 cm above the water line, which encourages the production of new side shoots. Supplied as an RFID-tagged rooted cutting for AquaPods, it provides a <strong>continuous and prolific yield of 50-80g of stems and leaves per week, with the first harvest ready just 25-30 days from planting.</strong></p>
