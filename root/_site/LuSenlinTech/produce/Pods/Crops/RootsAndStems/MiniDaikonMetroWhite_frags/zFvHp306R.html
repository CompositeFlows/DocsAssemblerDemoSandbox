<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The innovation of ‘Metro-White’ lies in its modified root architecture and selected biochemical profile for mildness.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compact, cylindrical, non-tapering form is a result of selecting for a dominant primary root with suppressed lateral root development, allowing it to form a uniform “finger” shape ideal for the constrained environment of a soil pod.</li>
  <li>Its mild flavour is due to a significantly reduced concentration of the glucosinolates that break down into pungent isothiocyanates (the compounds that give radishes their heat). This allows the natural sweetness and high water content to define the flavour profile.</li>
  <li>The crisp, non-pithy texture is maintained by a slow lignification process in the root’s vascular system and parenchyma cells, extending the harvest window for a tender, juicy root.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Mini Daikon ‘Metro-White’</strong> is a <strong>mild, crisp, and space-conscious</strong> radish, a specialized cultivar that makes the refreshing crunch and culinary versatility of daikon accessible to any urban container garden.</p>
