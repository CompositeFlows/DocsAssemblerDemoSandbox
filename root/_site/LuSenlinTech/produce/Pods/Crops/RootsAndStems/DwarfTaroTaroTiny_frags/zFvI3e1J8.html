<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Taro-Tiny’ offers the classic, comforting flavor of taro: a nutty, earthy sweetness with hints of vanilla and a texture that becomes soft and fluffy when cooked. The corms are small, rounded, and typically 5-8 cm in diameter, with distinctive concentric rings and pale flesh that may have lavender specks. The plant forms an attractive, compact cluster of upright, heart-shaped leaves on slender petioles, with some varieties showing dark purple veining or margins.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Dual-Purpose Tropical Staple</strong>
This taro’s compact nature makes both its roots and leaves accessible for various traditional and modern culinary applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Poached or Steamed Corms:</strong> The preferred method to enjoy its natural nutty flavor; once cooked, it can be mashed, sliced, or used as a potato alternative.</li>
  <li><strong>Taro Chips and Fries:</strong> Sliced thinly and fried or baked for a sweet, earthy snack with a beautiful pale lavender hue.</li>
  <li><strong>Taro Desserts and Paste:</strong> The key ingredient for traditional desserts like taro mochi, bubble tea, and sweet taro paste, where its color and flavor shine.</li>
  <li><strong>Cooked Young Leaves (<em>Laing</em>):</strong> The young, tender leaves must be cooked thoroughly to remove calcium oxalate crystals and can be used in traditional Filipino dishes like <em>laing</em> (taro leaves in coconut milk).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Taro-Tiny’ matures in one growing season, signaling readiness when the leaves begin to yellow in early autumn. The entire plant can be lifted from the container to reveal a cluster of small corms around a central mother corm. Supplied as an RFID-tagged starter tuber, a single plant provides a <strong>modest but valuable yield of 4-7 small, rounded corms totaling 300-500g, plus the bonus of ornamental, edible leaves throughout the season.</strong></p>
