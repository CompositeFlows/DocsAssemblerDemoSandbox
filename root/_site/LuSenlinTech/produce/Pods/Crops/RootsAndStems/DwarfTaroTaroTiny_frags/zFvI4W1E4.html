<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The development of ‘Taro-Tiny’ represents a significant achievement in root crop miniaturization and oxalate management.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The dwarf, clumping habit is the result of selecting for a suppressed lateral spreading gene and enhanced apical dominance, creating a plant that focuses energy on producing a compact cluster of corms rather than extensive underground runners.</li>
  <li>Its ability to produce quality corms in shallow soil is enabled by a modified root architecture that develops storage organs closer to the surface and in a more constricted space than wild varieties.</li>
  <li>While all taro contains calcium oxalate crystals that require cooking, ‘Taro-Tiny’ has been selected for lower raphide (needle-shaped crystal) density in both corms and leaves, reducing the irritant effect and making it somewhat safer to handle and prepare.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Dwarf Taro ‘Taro-Tiny’</strong> is a <strong>space-efficient, ornamental, and culinary-adapted</strong> variety, bringing the exotic appeal and versatile nutrition of traditional taro within reach of urban container gardeners.</p>
