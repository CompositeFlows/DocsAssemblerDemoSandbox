<p>‘Mini Stem’ is a space-optimized, rapid-maturing kohlrabi cultivar bred specifically for high-density container production and gourmet harvests. This dwarf variety forms perfectly spherical, pale green bulbs just 5-7 cm in diameter - the ideal single-serving size - while maintaining the crisp, sweet, and mildly broccoli-like flavor that defines quality kohlrabi. With its compact growth habit and tender, non-woody texture, ‘Mini Stem’ delivers the full kohlrabi experience in a miniature, balcony-friendly format.</p>
