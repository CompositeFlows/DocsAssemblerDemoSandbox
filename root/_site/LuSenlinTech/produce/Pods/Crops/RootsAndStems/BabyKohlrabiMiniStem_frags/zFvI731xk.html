<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Mini Stem’ offers a delicate, sweet flavor with notes of broccoli stem and a refreshing, crisp crunch reminiscent of a juicy apple. The bulbs are perfectly round, smooth-skinned, and pale celadon green, growing just above the soil surface. The flesh is uniformly white, crisp, and completely free of the woodiness that can develop in larger, over-mature kohlrabi. The plant produces a modest crown of upright, blue-green leaves on slender stems.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Crunchy Snack</strong>
This kohlrabi’s small size and perfect texture make it exceptionally versatile for both raw and cooked applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fresh Raw Snacking:</strong> The premier use - sliced into wedges or sticks for eating raw, providing a sweet, juicy, and refreshing crunch that needs no accompaniment.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads and Slaws:</strong> Can be shredded, julienned, or shaved thin to add a sweet, crisp element to salads and slaws, where it holds its texture beautifully.</li>
  <li><strong>Roasted or Sautéed:</strong> Halved or quartered, it roasts quickly, developing a sweet, caramelized exterior while maintaining a tender interior.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick Pickles:</strong> Its firm flesh and small size make it ideal for quick-pickling, creating crisp, tangy refrigerator pickles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Mini Stem’ matures with remarkable speed and uniformity. Harvest when the bulbs reach golf ball to tennis ball size, before they become overly large and potentially woody. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a <strong>dense and synchronized yield of 6-10 perfectly spherical bulbs, ready for harvest in just 45-50 days from sowing.</strong></p>
