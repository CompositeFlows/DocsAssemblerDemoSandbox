<p>‘Urban Lotus’ is a revolutionary dwarf lotus cultivar specifically bred for container production in shallow water trays, bringing the iconic crunch and beauty of lotus root to the smallest of spaces. This compact variety produces a dense cluster of small, crisp rhizomes with the classic symmetrical bore pattern, but on a scale manageable for balcony harvesting. It offers the same sweet, nutty, and refreshingly crisp qualities of traditional lotus, but with a significantly reduced growth habit and cultivation time.</p>
