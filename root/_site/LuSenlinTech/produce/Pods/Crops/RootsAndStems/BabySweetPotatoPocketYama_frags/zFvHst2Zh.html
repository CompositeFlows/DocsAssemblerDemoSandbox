<p>‘Pocket Yama’ is a revolutionary, compact-vining sweet potato bred specifically for container production and patio-scale harvests. This dwarf cultivar breaks from the sprawling nature of traditional varieties, forming a manageable, bushy vine that spills gracefully over pot edges while producing a concentrated cluster of small, jewel-like tubers. It delivers the classic, sweet, and moist orange flesh of a full-sized sweet potato, but in a personal-sized format perfect for single servings.</p>
