<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The appeal of ‘Tiny Kabu’ stems from its accelerated sugar development and selected biochemical profile for mildness.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rapid growth and sweet flavour are due to highly efficient conversion of starches to sugars in the root, combined with a thin, non-fibrous skin that minimizes protective compounds often associated with bitterness.</li>
  <li>Its uniform, round shape results from a controlled root bulking process where the root develops symmetrically without the elongation common in many turnip varieties.</li>
  <li>The hairless, mild greens are a selected trait that reduces oxalic acid content and eliminates the trichomes (small hairs) found on many turnip greens, resulting in a more palatable and tender leaf perfect for fresh eating.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Tokyo Turnip ‘Tiny Kabu’</strong> is a <strong>fast, sweet, and dual-purpose</strong> delicacy, a refined variety that offers the gourmet appeal of Japanese vegetables in a miniature, balcony-friendly format.</p>
