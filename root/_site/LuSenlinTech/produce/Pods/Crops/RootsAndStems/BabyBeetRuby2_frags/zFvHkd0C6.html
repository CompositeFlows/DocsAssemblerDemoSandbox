<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The success of ‘Ruby 2’ is founded on its accelerated sugar development, uniform shape, and reduced geosmin production.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rapid development and intense sweetness are due to a highly efficient photosynthesis-to-sucrose conversion pathway in the root, alongside a gene that promotes early and uniform root bulking, preventing the toughness that can occur in slower-growing beets.</li>
  <li>The perfect spherical shape is a result of selecting for a symmetrical root meristem and a thin, delicate taproot, allowing the storage root to form a uniform ball ideal for container growth and consistent cooking times.</li>
  <li>The mild flavour in both roots and greens is achieved by selecting for low geosmin levels and a favourable balance of oxalic acid in the leaves, resulting in a sweeter, less earthy root and a more palatable, tender green.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Baby Beet ‘Ruby 2’</strong> is a <strong>sweet, dual-purpose, and space-smart</strong> variety, a genetic refinement that offers a rapid, bountiful, and beautiful harvest of roots and greens from the most compact of growing spaces.</p>
