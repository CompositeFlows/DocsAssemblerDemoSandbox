<p>‘Ruby 2’ is a gourmet, dual-purpose baby beet cultivar perfected for rapid cycling and high-density container production. This dwarf variety forms perfectly spherical, deep crimson roots no larger than a ping-pong ball, accompanied by a prolific bunch of tender, dark green leaves with vibrant red veins. Bred for exceptional sweetness and minimal earthy bitterness, ‘Ruby 2’ delivers the full, rich flavour of a mature beet in a miniature, space-efficient package, ensuring no part of the plant goes to waste.</p>

<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Ruby 2’ offers a remarkably sweet, earthy flavour with subtle nutty undertones and very low geosmin content, the compound responsible for strong earthy notes. The roots are perfectly round, smooth-skinned, and intensely ruby-red throughout, with no internal zoning or woodiness. The greens are tender, glossy, and have a flavour similar to Swiss chard, but more delicate and less pungent.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Dual-Harvest Gourmet</strong>
This beet’s value is in its complete usability, providing two distinct, high-quality crops from a single plant.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Whole Roasted or Glazed:</strong> Their small size allows them to be roasted or steamed whole, becoming meltingly tender and intensely sweet, perfect for salads or as a glazed side dish.</li>
  <li><strong>Pickled and Preserved:</strong> The classic use for baby beets, creating vibrant, sweet-and-sour pickles that retain their firm texture and beautiful colour.</li>
  <li><strong>Fresh Greens Sauté:</strong> The young leaves and stems can be harvested continuously and sautéed with garlic as a nutrient-dense side, or used raw in salads when very young.</li>
  <li><strong>Vibrant Purees and Hummus:</strong> Creates the most brilliantly coloured, sweet purees, soups, and vibrant pink hummus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Ruby 2’ is a fast-maturing, determinate-type beet. For a dual harvest, young greens can be carefully picked without harming the developing root. The primary root harvest occurs when they reach 3-4 cm in diameter. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a <strong>dense and uniform yield of 5-8 perfectly formed baby beets and a substantial bunch of greens, with roots ready for harvest in just 45-50 days from sowing.</strong></p>

<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The success of ‘Ruby 2’ is founded on its accelerated sugar development, uniform shape, and reduced geosmin production.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rapid development and intense sweetness are due to a highly efficient photosynthesis-to-sucrose conversion pathway in the root, alongside a gene that promotes early and uniform root bulking, preventing the toughness that can occur in slower-growing beets.</li>
  <li>The perfect spherical shape is a result of selecting for a symmetrical root meristem and a thin, delicate taproot, allowing the storage root to form a uniform ball ideal for container growth and consistent cooking times.</li>
  <li>The mild flavour in both roots and greens is achieved by selecting for low geosmin levels and a favourable balance of oxalic acid in the leaves, resulting in a sweeter, less earthy root and a more palatable, tender green.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Baby Beet ‘Ruby 2’</strong> is a <strong>sweet, dual-purpose, and space-smart</strong> variety, a genetic refinement that offers a rapid, bountiful, and beautiful harvest of roots and greens from the most compact of growing spaces.</p>
