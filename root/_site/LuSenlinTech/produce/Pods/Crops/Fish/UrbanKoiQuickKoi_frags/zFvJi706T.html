<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Quick-Koi’ offers a rich, full-bodied flavor with a firm, large-flake texture and a clean, slightly sweet finish. The flesh is white with a faint pinkish hue from its natural diet, and it retains moisture exceptionally well during cooking. The fish itself is a living work of art, displaying the classic, high-contrast color patterns of premium ornamental koi, but in a compact, deep-bodied form.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ornamental Culinary Centerpiece</strong>
This koi’s primary value lies in its breathtaking appearance, making it the ultimate choice for whole-fish presentations where visual drama is paramount.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Steamed Whole:</strong> The premier preparation - steamed with ginger, scallions, and light soy, creating a stunning centerpiece where the vibrant patterns remain visible through the translucent, cooked flesh.</li>
  <li><strong>Sashimi or Usuzukuri:</strong> For the adventurous, ultra-fresh ‘Quick-Koi’ can be sliced paper-thin for sashimi, showcasing the quality of the flesh and the beauty of its skin.</li>
  <li><strong>Salt-Crusted Baking:</strong> A thick salt crust baked onto the whole fish creates a dramatic tableside presentation, with the crust cracked open to reveal the perfectly steamed, flavorful flesh inside.</li>
  <li><strong>Confit or Slow-Poaching:</strong> Gently cooked in oil or aromatized broth at low temperatures, resulting in an incredibly tender, moist texture that highlights its rich flavor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Growth &amp; Harvest Cycle</strong>
‘Quick-Koi’ is engineered for a rapid, determinate growth curve, reaching its precise harvest size of 180 grams in a predictable timeframe. It thrives in clean, well-oxygenated water that preserves its brilliant coloration. In a recirculating system, a cohort provides a <strong>synchronized, high-value harvest of 15-20 visually uniform fish per 100-liter barrel, reaching the target 180g harvest weight in just 14-16 weeks from fry.</strong></p>
