<p>‘Air-Breather Mini’ is a dwarf, highly adaptable strain of walking catfish (<em>Clarias batrachus</em>) engineered for the unique conditions of urban aquaculture. This cultivar combines a compact adult size with the remarkable ability to breathe atmospheric air, making it exceptionally resilient in high-density systems where oxygen levels can fluctuate. Reaching a perfect harvest size of 150-200 grams, ‘Air-Breather Mini’ delivers a rich, robust flavor and uniquely firm, almost meat-like texture that stands apart from most freshwater fish.</p>
