<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Pocket Stripe’ offers the quintessential, sweet and mild channel catfish flavor with a clean, tender flake and a notably low oil content. The flesh is pearly white and delicate, yet holds together well when cooked gently. The fish itself is streamlined and athletic in appearance, with a bright silver body, a stark black “pocket stripe” running from gill to tail, and contrasting dark fins.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Mild, Flaky Classic</strong>
This catfish’s delicate flavor and texture make it the ideal choice for traditional preparations where the quality of the fish itself is the star.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pan-Fried Fillets:</strong> The classic Southern preparation - lightly coated in cornmeal and pan-fried to a golden brown, creating a crisp exterior that gives way to tender, moist flesh.</li>
  <li><strong>Baked or Broiled:</strong> Cooks beautifully with simple seasonings like lemon, paprika, and butter, allowing its natural sweetness to shine.</li>
  <li><strong>Catfish Nuggets:</strong> Perfectly sized for bite-sized nuggets, ideal for frying or baking as a healthy, crowd-pleasing appetizer.</li>
  <li><strong>Fish Stews and Gumbos:</strong> Adds a delicate, sweet flavor to soups and stews, flaking apart perfectly in the final moments of cooking.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Growth &amp; Harvest Cycle</strong>
‘Pocket Stripe’ exhibits a rapid, predictable growth curve, reaching its genetically determined maximum size efficiently. It thrives in clean, well-oxygenated water and is less tolerant of poor conditions than its ‘Air-Breather’ cousin, making it an indicator of a healthy system. Reared in a BioFlocLite™ or clear-water system, a cohort provides a <strong>synchronized harvest, yielding 12-16 uniform fish per 100-liter barrel, reaching optimal harvest size of 220g in just 4-5 months from fingerlings.</strong></p>
