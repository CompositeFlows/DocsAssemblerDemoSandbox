<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘CoolStream’ offers the quintessential trout flavor: a clean, nutty, and slightly sweet taste with a delicate, moist flake and a beautiful pink-orange flesh color derived from its controlled astaxanthin diet. The flesh is tender yet firm enough to hold together on a grill. The fish has a classic, streamlined torpedo shape with vibrant speckled skin and a pronounced pink lateral stripe.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Cold-Water Gourmet</strong>
This trout’s superior flavor and classic appearance make it a premium product suited for simple preparations that highlight its quality.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pan-Seared or Grilled:</strong> The premier method - cooked quickly with the skin on to develop a crisp exterior, often finished with almonds and brown butter to complement its nutty notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Whole Baked or Salt-Crusted:</strong> Baking whole preserves its moisture and delicate flavor, with a salt crust creating a perfectly seasoned, dramatic presentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Smoked:</strong> Its firm flesh and balanced fat content make it exceptional for cold or hot smoking, resulting in a delicately flavored product far superior to commercial offerings.</li>
  <li><strong>Trout Meunière:</strong> The classic French preparation, lightly floured and sautéed in butter with lemon and parsley, is an ideal match for its subtle flavor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Growth &amp; Harvest Cycle</strong>
‘CoolStream’ requires a dedicated chilled water system but rewards the investment with exceptional flavor and growth efficiency within its specific temperature range. It is highly sensitive to water quality, serving as an indicator species for a well-maintained system. Reared in a specialized chilled BioFlocLite™ system, a cohort provides a <strong>high-value harvest of 10-15 fish per 100-liter barrel, reaching optimal size of 240g in 6-7 months from fingerlings.</strong></p>
