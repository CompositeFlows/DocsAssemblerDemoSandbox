<p>‘T-Civic’ is a revolutionary, fully patented dwarf tilapia strain (<em>Oreochromis niloticus</em> var. <em>civicus</em>) engineered from the ground up for the unique constraints and opportunities of urban aquaculture. This fish represents a paradigm shift in genetics, selected not for pond-based mass production but for individual welfare, efficient feed conversion, and impeccable flavor in high-density recirculating systems. Reaching a perfect plate size of 180-220 grams, ‘T-Civic’ delivers a clean, mild, and sweet flavor with a remarkably consistent flake, free of the off-flavors that can plague tank-raised fish.</p>
