<p>‘Nano-Razor’ is a miniature, fast-burrowing strain of razor clam (<em>Ensis directus</em>) engineered for container substrate aquaculture. This cultivar replicates the classic elongated, straight-sided shell of its wild relatives but at a compact 6-8 cm length, making it perfectly suited for shallow sand beds. Selected for its rapid vertical burrowing ability and sweet, tender meat, ‘Nano-Razor’ delivers the prized crisp texture and clean, oceanic flavor of razor clams in an urban-friendly format.</p>
