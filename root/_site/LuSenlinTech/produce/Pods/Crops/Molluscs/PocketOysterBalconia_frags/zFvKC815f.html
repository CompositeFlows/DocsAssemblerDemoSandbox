<p>‘Balconia’ is a dwarf, cup-shaped strain of Pacific oyster (<em>Crassostrea gigas</em>) specifically developed for vertical cultivation in urban marine systems. This cultivar forms small, deep-cupped shells reaching just 5-7 cm in diameter, with a distinctive fluted, porcelain-like appearance. Selected for its ability to thrive in high-density suspended culture, ‘Balconia’ delivers the classic oyster profile - intense brininess followed by sweet, metallic notes and a crisp, firm texture - in a perfectly portioned single bite.</p>
