<p>‘Sweet-Dot’ is a dwarf, free-swimming strain of bay scallop (<em>Argopecten irradians</em>) engineered for container aquaculture and exceptional sweetness. This cultivar reaches a petite 2.5-3.5 cm in diameter, developing the classic fan-shaped shell with subtle pink and brown radial patterns. Unlike many bivalves, ‘Sweet-Dot’ retains the ability to swim short distances in tank environments, adding dynamic behavior to the system. It delivers an intensely sweet, nutty flavor with a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture that surpasses larger scallop varieties in delicacy.</p>
