<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The unique qualities of ‘Sweet-Dot’ derive from its specialized metabolism and maintained swimming behavior in captivity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The intense sweetness results from selective breeding for scallops with enhanced glycogen storage in the adductor muscle and efficient conversion of filtered nutrients into natural sugars.</li>
  <li>The maintained swimming ability in tank conditions is a rare trait achieved by selecting for individuals with strong jet propulsion mechanics and orientation behavior, making them both functional and fascinating to observe.</li>
  <li>The dwarf size and synchronized growth are controlled by selecting for early reproductive maturity at a small size, redirecting energy from shell growth to meat quality and flavor development.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Micro Scallop ‘Sweet-Dot’</strong> is a <strong>flavor-intense, behaviorally active, and space-efficient</strong> cultivar, a gourmet specialty that brings the dynamic beauty and exceptional sweetness of scallops to the smallest urban marine systems.</p>
