<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Sweet-Dot’ offers an extraordinarily sweet, almost candied flavor with distinct hazelnut undertones and a remarkably tender, delicate texture. The adductor muscle is small but perfectly formed, cooking to an opaque white with a buttery softness. The meat has a higher natural sugar content than most bivalves, creating a caramelized exterior when seared. Live specimens display vibrant blue eyespots along the mantle edge and active swimming behavior.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Delicate Sweet Specialty</strong>
This scallop’s intense sweetness and petite size make it ideal for applications where subtlety and rapid cooking are essential.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quick Sear or Ceviche:</strong> The premier preparation - seared for mere seconds to caramelize the natural sugars or “cooked” in citrus juice for ceviche, preserving their delicate texture.</li>
  <li><strong>Raw Crudo or Sashimi:</strong> Served raw with minimal accompaniments like high-quality olive oil and sea salt to highlight their natural sweetness.</li>
  <li><strong>Scallop Butter Sauté:</strong> Quickly sautéed in brown butter with fresh herbs, where their small size ensures even cooking and perfect texture.</li>
  <li><strong>Gourmet Garnish:</strong> Used whole as an elegant garnish for seafood dishes, adding both visual appeal and bursts of sweet flavor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Sweet-Dot’ is a rapid-growing, active filter feeder that thrives in well-oxygenated water with moderate flow. Their swimming ability helps them maintain optimal positioning for feeding. In a Haloponic™ system with suspended trays, a square meter of growing space can yield <strong>2-3 kg of premium micro scallops over a 10-12 week cycle, reaching harvest size of 3 cm in 9-10 weeks from spat.</strong></p>
