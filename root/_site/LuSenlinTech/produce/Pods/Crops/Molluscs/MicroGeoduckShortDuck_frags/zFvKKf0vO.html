<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The innovation of ‘Short-Duck’ represents a breakthrough in bivalve growth regulation and morphology control.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The truncated siphon length while maintaining texture quality is achieved through selective breeding for early siphon maturation and efficient nutrient partitioning to the edible portions.</li>
  <li>The accelerated growth rate in artificial systems comes from selecting for geoducks with highly efficient filter feeding and siphon extension behavior optimized for constant water flow conditions.</li>
  <li>Their adaptation to shallower burrowing depths is a key urban adaptation, achieved by breeding for animals that thrive in the constrained vertical space of container systems without compromising meat quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Micro Geoduck ‘Short-Duck’</strong> is a <strong>texture-unique, rapidly-maturing, and space-adapted</strong> cultivar, a miniature marvel that brings the legendary crunch and sweetness of geoduck within practical reach of urban aquaculture enthusiasts.</p>
