<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The efficiency of ‘Surf-Sky’ stems from its optimized filtration system and controlled growth patterns.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rapid growth and uniform size are achieved by selecting for clams with highly efficient siphon systems and synchronized metabolic rates, allowing them to reach market size quickly in nutrient-rich recirculating systems.</li>
  <li>The mild, sweet flavor profile is enhanced through selective breeding for optimal glycogen storage and balanced amino acid composition in the meat.</li>
  <li>Their adaptation to high-density culture comes from breeding for reduced territorial behavior and enhanced tolerance to close proximity with other filter feeders.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Skyline Surf Clam ‘Surf-Sky’</strong> is a <strong>rapid-growing, flavor-mild, and space-efficient</strong> cultivar, bringing the versatile culinary qualities of ocean surf clams to urban aquaculture systems with reliable production and consistent quality.</p>
