<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Metro-Gold’ offers the prized Manila clam flavor: exceptionally sweet and buttery with minimal chewiness and a clean, briny finish. The meat is tender and plump, ranging from creamy beige to subtle orange when cooked. The shells are oval-shaped with distinctive concentric rings and a beautiful golden-brown coloration that makes them stand out from common clams. Their consistent small size ensures even cooking and perfect single-bite portions.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Sweet, Versatile Bivalve</strong>
This clam’s superior sweetness and tender texture make it ideal for both simple and complex preparations where its flavor can shine.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clams in White Wine Sauce:</strong> The premier preparation - steamed quickly with garlic, white wine, and butter until they just open, creating a sublime broth.</li>
  <li><strong>Pasta alle Vongole:</strong> The classic Italian pasta dish where their sweet flavor and tender texture perfectly complement garlic, olive oil, and parsley.</li>
  <li><strong>Clam Chowder:</strong> Provides sweet, tender morsels for both creamy New England and clear broth Manhattan-style chowders.</li>
  <li><strong>Raw on the Half-Shell:</strong> Small, premium specimens can be served raw with a squeeze of lemon or mignonette sauce.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Metro-Gold’ is a rapid-growing, prolific burrower that thrives in 5-10 cm of coarse sand or specialized substrate. They actively filter feed, improving water clarity and quality. In a Haloponic™ substrate bed, a square meter can yield <strong>3-5 kg of premium clams over an 8-10 week cycle, reaching optimal harvest size of 3.5 cm in as little as 7 weeks from juvenile seeding.</strong></p>
