<p>‘Metro-Gold’ is a fast-burrowing, golden-shelled strain of Manila clam (<em>Ruditapes philippinarum</em>) selected for its exceptional performance in shallow substrate systems and striking appearance. This cultivar combines the classic sweet, buttery flavor of Manila clams with a distinctive golden-hued shell and rapid growth cycle ideal for urban aquaculture. Reaching a perfect plate size of 3-4 cm, ‘Metro-Gold’ actively filters water while developing in coarse sand or specialized substrate beds, making it both an efficient ecosystem component and a gourmet treasure.</p>
