<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The luxurious quality of ‘Cream-Dot’ stems from its unique lipid profile and controlled maturation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The exceptional buttery flavor and texture result from selective breeding for clams with higher concentrations of specific lipids and glycogen, creating a naturally richer, more unctuous meat composition.</li>
  <li>The tender, non-rubbery texture is achieved through breeding for a specific collagen structure and muscle fiber density that breaks down more readily during cooking.</li>
  <li>Their synchronized fat deposition during the final growth phase is a selected trait that ensures consistent quality and flavor development across the harvest population.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Butter Clam ‘Cream-Dot’</strong> is a <strong>flavor-rich, texture-luxurious, and maturation-controlled</strong> cultivar, a specialty bivalve that brings the indulgent, buttery essence of wild butter clams to urban aquaculture with unparalleled consistency and quality.</p>
