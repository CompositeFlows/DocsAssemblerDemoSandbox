<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The success of ‘Closed-Sea’ lies in its adapted filtration efficiency and reproductive control for closed systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The accelerated growth rate is achieved by selecting strains with highly efficient filter-feeding apparatus and metabolic systems optimized for the consistent, nutrient-rich algal suspensions used in recirculating systems.</li>
  <li>Their adaptability to stable, artificial salinity levels (20-25 ppt) is a result of selective breeding for osmoregulatory efficiency, allowing them to thrive far from natural tidal fluctuations.</li>
  <li>The synchronized growth and reduced spawning frequency are engineered traits that direct energy toward meat production rather than reproductive cycles, ensuring plump, consistent quality year-round.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Urban Mussel ‘Closed-Sea’</strong> is a <strong>rapid-filtering, space-efficient, and flavor-authentic</strong> cultivar, a cornerstone species for urban marine aquaculture that transforms waste nutrients into gourmet shellfish while purifying the aquatic environment.</p>
