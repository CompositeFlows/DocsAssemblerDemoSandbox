<p>‘Midnight Kiss’ is a dwarf, free-flowering viola cultivar bred for its dramatic coloration and exceptional culinary quality. This compact variety produces an abundance of velvety, near-black flowers with subtle golden-yellow “faces” and a delicate, sweet perfume. Unlike many edible flowers that offer only visual appeal, ‘Midnight Kiss’ delivers a complex flavor profile alongside its stunning appearance, all while maintaining a tidy, mounding habit perfect for container edges and tower gardens.</p>
