<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Midnight Kiss’ offers a sophisticated flavor profile: initial notes of wintergreen and grape, followed by a subtle floral sweetness with hints of mint, and a clean, tender texture. The flowers are 2-3 cm in diameter with velvety, deep purple-black petals and a small golden-yellow center that creates a striking “kiss” of contrast. The plant forms a dense, symmetrical mound of heart-shaped leaves just 15-20 cm tall, covered in blooms throughout the season.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Dramatic Garnish</strong>
This viola’s intense color and complex flavor make it unparalleled for creating memorable culinary presentations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dessert Elegance:</strong> The premier use - as a stunning contrast on light-colored desserts like panna cotta, cheesecake, vanilla ice cream, or white chocolate creations.</li>
  <li><strong>Salad and Cheese Accent:</strong> Scattered over green salads or cheese boards where the dark flowers create dramatic visual impact against bright ingredients.</li>
  <li><strong>Candied Flower Specialty:</strong> Their sturdy petals and sweet base flavor make them ideal for crystallizing, creating exquisite dark jewels for decorating cakes and pastries.</li>
  <li><strong>Cocktail and Beverage Drama:</strong> Floating in champagne, white wine, or clear cocktails where they create a breathtaking “midnight sky” effect.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Midnight Kiss’ is a continuous bloomer when harvested regularly. Pick flowers in the morning when they are fully open but still fresh, choosing those with the deepest coloration. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>consistent yield of 25-35 perfect flowers per week, with first blooms appearing 55 days after germination and continuing until hard frost.</strong></p>
