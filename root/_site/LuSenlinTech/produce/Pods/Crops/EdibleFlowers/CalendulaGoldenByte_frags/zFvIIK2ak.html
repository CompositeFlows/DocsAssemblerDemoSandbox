<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Golden Byte’ delivers a sophisticated flavor profile beginning with the classic saffron-like earthiness of calendula, followed by subtle peppery notes and a hint of citrus. The flowers are fully double, 5-7 cm in diameter, with dense petals in shades of deep orange, bright gold, and buttery yellow. The plant forms a compact, branching mound 20-25 cm tall with lance-shaped, aromatic green leaves.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Saffron-Alternative &amp; Healing Flower</strong>
This calendula’s rich color and complex flavor make it valuable for both culinary and wellness applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rice and Grain Coloring:</strong> The premier culinary use - petals impart a beautiful golden hue and subtle flavor to rice, risottos, and grain dishes as a sustainable saffron alternative.</li>
  <li><strong>Herbal Teas and Infusions:</strong> Dried or fresh petals create vibrant, golden teas with earthy, soothing flavors and potential anti-inflammatory benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>Compound Butters and Oils:</strong> Steeped in oils or mixed into butters, they add both color and a subtle peppery-saffron flavor to sauces and spreads.</li>
  <li><strong>Skin-Salve Base:</strong> The high concentration of triterpenoids and flavonoids makes it ideal for creating healing balms and skin-care infusions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Golden Byte’ is a continuous bloomer when harvested regularly. Pick flowers when they are fully open but still fresh, preferably in morning after dew has evaporated. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>consistent yield of 15-25 prime flowers per week, with first harvest beginning 55-60 days after germination and continuing throughout the growing season.</strong></p>
