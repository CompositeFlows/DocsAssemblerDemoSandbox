<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Lemon Arrow’ delivers an intense, pure lemon flavor with a crisp, succulent texture and a clean finish free of metallic aftertaste. The leaves are distinctively arrow-shaped, glossy, and medium green with prominent veining, growing in upright clusters from a central crown. The plant forms a dense, self-supporting mound that remains attractive and productive through multiple seasons.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Natural Citrus Seasoning</strong>
This sorrel’s powerful acidity and bright flavor make it an exceptional finishing herb and flavor enhancer.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Soup and Sauce Finisher:</strong> The classic use - finely chopped and stirred into creamy soups, sauces, and pan drippings at the last moment to add instant brightness.</li>
  <li><strong>Salad Citrus Replacement:</strong> Can replace lemon juice or vinegar in salad dressings when blended into vinaigrettes, providing both acidity and fresh green notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Fish and Seafood Partner:</strong> A natural companion to fatty fish and seafood, where its acidity cuts through richness perfectly.</li>
  <li><strong>Compound Butter and Spreads:</strong> Chopped and mixed into butter, cream cheese, or yogurt for instant citrus-herb spreads.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Lemon Arrow’ is a cut-and-come-again perennial that becomes more productive with regular harvesting. Pick individual leaves from the outside of the plant, or cut entire stems 5 cm above the crown. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>consistent yield of 15-25 intensely flavored leaves per week, with harvests possible year-round in protected balcony conditions.</strong></p>
