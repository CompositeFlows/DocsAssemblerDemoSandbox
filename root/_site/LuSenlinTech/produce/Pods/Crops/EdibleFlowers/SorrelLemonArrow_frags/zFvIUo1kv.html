<p>The distinction of ‘Lemon Arrow’ lies in its optimized acid profile and compact growth genetics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The intense, clean lemon flavor results from selecting for high concentrations of ascorbic acid and specific fruit-acid profiled oxalates, while reducing the harsher oxalic crystals that can create a chalky mouthfeel in common sorrel.</li>
  <li>The compact, upright habit is achieved through breeding for shorter petioles and stronger leaf architecture, creating a plant that resists flopping and maximizes light exposure in dense plantings.</li>
  <li>The extended harvest window and reduced bolting tendency come from selecting for day-length neutrality and temperature-stable growth patterns, allowing consistent leaf production regardless of seasonal changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Sorrel ‘Lemon Arrow’</strong> is a <strong>perennial, intensely citrus, and space-adapted</strong> green, a refined cultivar that delivers year-round bursts of natural lemon flavor from the most compact of growing spaces.</p>
