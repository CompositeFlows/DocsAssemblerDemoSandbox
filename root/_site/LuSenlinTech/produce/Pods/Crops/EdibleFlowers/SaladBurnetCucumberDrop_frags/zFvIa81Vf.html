<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The excellence of ‘Cucumber Drop’ lies in its stabilized volatile oil production and optimized growth architecture.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The intense, pure cucumber flavor results from selecting for specific chemotypes with high concentrations of trans-2-hexenal and other cucumber aroma compounds, while minimizing the tannins that can cause bitterness in older leaves.</li>
  <li>The compact, symmetrical growth habit is achieved through breeding for shortened internodes and enhanced apical dominance, creating a plant that maintains its ornamental quality while maximizing leaf production.</li>
  <li>The extended harvest window and reduced flowering tendency come from selecting for day-length insensitivity and temperature-stable growth patterns, ensuring consistent leaf quality throughout the seasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Salad Burnet ‘Cucumber Drop’</strong> is a <strong>flavor-concentrated, space-efficient, and perpetually productive</strong> herb, a refined cultivar that delivers the pure essence of cucumber in a beautiful, balcony-friendly package.</p>
