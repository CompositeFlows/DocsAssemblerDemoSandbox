<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Cucumber Drop’ offers an exceptionally clean, potent cucumber flavor with subtle melon undertones and no bitter aftertaste. The leaves are small, rounded, and deeply serrated, arranged in perfect whorls around slender stems. The plant forms a dense, symmetrical mound 15-20 cm tall and wide, with a delicate, lacy appearance that belies its robust productivity.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Cucumber Flavor Alternative</strong>
This burnet’s intense cucumber essence and attractive form make it incredibly versatile for both culinary and beverage applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Herbal Water and Cocktails:</strong> The premier use - leaves muddled or steeped in water, lemonade, or gin-based cocktails to impart instant, fresh cucumber flavor without dilution.</li>
  <li><strong>Salad and Sandwich Herb:</strong> Chopped and sprinkled over green salads, potato salad, or sandwiches where it provides cucumber flavor without the watery texture of actual cucumbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Dipping Sauces and Raitas:</strong> Finely minced and mixed into yogurt-based dips, tzatziki, or raitas for immediate cucumber flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Garnish with Purpose:</strong> Whole sprigs used as edible garnishes that actually contribute significant flavor to finished dishes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Cucumber Drop’ is a cut-and-come-again perennial that becomes bushier with regular harvesting. Pick individual leaves or cut entire stems 3-4 cm above the crown. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>consistent yield of 20-30 flavorful sprigs per week, with harvests beginning 45 days after germination and continuing year-round in protected conditions.</strong></p>
