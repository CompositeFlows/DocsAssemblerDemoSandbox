<p>‘Cucumber Drop’ is a compact, high-yielding cultivar of salad burnet bred specifically for container production and intense flavor expression. This dwarf variety forms tidy, symmetrical rosettes of finely serrated, blue-green leaves that deliver an astonishingly pure and potent cucumber flavor. Unlike traditional salad burnet that can become woody and bitter, ‘Cucumber Drop’ maintains its delicate texture and refreshing taste throughout the growing season, making it the ultimate cucumber-flavored herb for space-limited gardens.</p>
