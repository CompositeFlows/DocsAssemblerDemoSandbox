<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Sky-Blue’ offers an intense, clean cucumber flavor with subtle sweet and mineral notes. The flowers are the signature true blue, star-shaped blooms that maintain their vibrant color, while the leaves are smaller, more tender, and less bristly than standard borage. The plant forms a dense, rounded mound 25-30 cm in height and spread, with multiple branching stems that keep the iconic flowers displayed prominently.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Refreshing Cucumber Accent</strong>
This borage’s vibrant color and crisp flavor make it exceptionally versatile for both culinary and beverage applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Signature Cocktail Garnish:</strong> The ultimate use - floating a single star-shaped flower in summer drinks, lemonades, or gin and tonics for stunning visual appeal and subtle cucumber essence.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads and Desserts:</strong> Scattered over green salads, fruit salads, or light desserts to add bursts of color and refreshing flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Flower Ice Cubes:</strong> Frozen into ice cubes or rings to transform ordinary beverages into extraordinary presentations.</li>
  <li><strong>Young Leaf Salads:</strong> The youngest, most tender leaves can be finely chopped and added to salads for a cucumber flavor boost without the texture of mature leaves.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Sky-Blue’ is a continuous producer when harvested regularly. Pick flowers daily as they open, choosing the freshest blooms for optimal color and flavor. Young leaves can be harvested sparingly. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>steady yield of 20-30 perfect blue flowers per week, with first blooms appearing just 60 days after germination and continuing until frost.</strong></p>
