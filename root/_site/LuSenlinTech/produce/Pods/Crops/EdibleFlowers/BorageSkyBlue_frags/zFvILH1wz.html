<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The innovation of ‘Sky-Blue’ lies in its controlled growth habit and stabilized pigment production.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compact, non-spreading form is achieved through selective breeding for a bushy growth gene and reduced apical dominance, creating a self-supporting plant that doesn’t require the staking needed by traditional tall borage varieties.</li>
  <li>The intense blue flower color results from stabilized anthocyanin production specifically for the delphinidin-based pigments that create borage’s unique blue hue, ensuring consistent color regardless of environmental conditions.</li>
  <li>The reduced leaf bristliness and enhanced cucumber flavor come from selecting for plants with smaller trichomes and higher concentrations of the aldehyde compounds responsible for fresh cucumber aroma and taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Borage ‘Sky-Blue’</strong> is a <strong>space-adapted, flavor-intense, and perpetually blooming</strong> edible flower, a domesticated version of a classic herb that brings continuous celestial beauty and refreshing flavor to the urban gardener’s palette.</p>
