<p>‘Crystal Leaf’ is a succulent, ground-covering cultivar of ice plant specifically selected for container cultivation and culinary excellence. This low-growing variety forms a dense mat of finger-like leaves covered in sparkling, refractive bladder cells that glisten like ice crystals. The plant offers a remarkable salty-crisp flavor profile and a texture unlike any other green, making it both an ornamental curiosity and a gourmet ingredient for the innovative urban cook.</p>
