<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Chop-Chop’ offers the classic shungiku profile: a distinctive aromatic flavor with notes of chrysanthemum, mint, and pine, followed by a pleasant, mild bitterness that cleanses the palate. The leaves are deeply serrated, tender, and bright green, growing on multiple branching stems from a central crown. The plant maintains a compact, mounded form that maximizes leaf production in minimal space.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Essential Hot Pot &amp; Soup Green</strong>
This green’s unique flavor and quick-cooking nature make it indispensable in specific culinary applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hot Pot Essential:</strong> The premier use - added to soups, nabemono, and hot pots during the final seconds of cooking, where it wilts perfectly and imparts its signature aroma.</li>
  <li><strong>Ohitashi (Japanese Blanched Salad):</strong> Briefly blanched and dressed with dashi, soy, and bonito flakes to create a classic side dish.</li>
  <li><strong>Tempura:</strong> Dipped in light batter and quick-fried, which tempers the bitterness while highlighting the herbal notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Rice and Noodle Enhancer:</strong> Chopped and stirred into steamed rice or noodle dishes during the final moments of cooking.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Chop-Chop’ lives up to its name with remarkably fast regrowth. Harvest by cutting stems 5-7 cm above the base, or pick individual leaves starting from the outside. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>rapid and abundant yield of 40-60g of aromatic greens per week, with first harvest ready just 30 days after germination and regrowth occurring within 10-14 days of cutting.</strong></p>
