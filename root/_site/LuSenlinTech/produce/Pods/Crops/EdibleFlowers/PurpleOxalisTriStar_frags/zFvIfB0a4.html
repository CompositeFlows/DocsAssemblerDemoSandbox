<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The culinary success of ‘TriStar’ lies in its balanced oxalate chemistry and stable pigmentation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pleasant, manageable tartness results from selecting for a specific oxalic acid concentration that provides the desirable sorrel-like zing without the mouth-puckering intensity or potential toxicity concerns of wild oxalis species.</li>
  <li>The stable deep purple coloration comes from consistent anthocyanin production in the leaves, maintained through selective breeding for color stability across varying light conditions.</li>
  <li>The compact, non-invasive growth habit is engineered through selection for a clumping rather than running root system, making it well-behaved in container gardens unlike its weedy relatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Purple Oxalis ‘TriStar’</strong> is a <strong>colorful, tangy, and well-mannered</strong> ornamental edible, a domesticated version of a wild plant that brings both striking beauty and reliable citrus-sorrel flavor to the urban gardener’s palette.</p>
