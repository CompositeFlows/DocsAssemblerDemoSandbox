<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘TriStar’ offers a clean, sharp lemon-sorrel flavor with subtle herbal undertones and a crisp, juicy texture. The leaves are triangular, deep burgundy-purple with a lighter central marking, arranged in symmetrical groups of three on slender burgundy stems. The plant grows as a dense, clumping mound 15-20 cm tall and wide, with the characteristic nyctinastic movement (leaf folding) that adds living interest.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Colorful Tangy Accent</strong>
This oxalis’s vibrant color and bright acidity make it ideal for uses where both visual impact and flavor matter.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Salad Brightener:</strong> A few leaves scattered through green salads provide dramatic color contrast and a burst of citrusy tang that reduces the need for dressing.</li>
  <li><strong>Seafood and Avocado Garnish:</strong> The perfect accompaniment to rich foods like salmon, scallops, or avocado toast where its color and acidity balance fat content.</li>
  <li><strong>Cocktail and Beverage Garnish:</strong> Used as a stunning rim garnish or floated in drinks where it adds both visual appeal and subtle tartness.</li>
  <li><strong>Dessert Decoration:</strong> The purple leaves and pink flowers create exquisite decorations for cakes and desserts, providing both beauty and a surprising flavor contrast.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘TriStar’ is a moderate but continuous producer when harvested thoughtfully. Pick individual leaves from the outer portion of the plant, taking care not to remove more than one-third of the foliage at once. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>steady yield of 15-25 flavorful leaves per week, with harvests beginning 60 days after planting and continuing year-round in indoor or protected conditions.</strong></p>
