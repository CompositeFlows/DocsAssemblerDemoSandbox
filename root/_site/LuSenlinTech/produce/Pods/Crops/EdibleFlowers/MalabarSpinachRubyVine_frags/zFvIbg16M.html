<p>‘Ruby Vine’ is a compact, highly ornamental cultivar of Malabar spinach specifically bred for vertical container production and extreme heat tolerance. This semi-determinate vine showcases stunning ruby-red stems and deep green, heart-shaped leaves with contrasting red veins, creating a beautiful edible display. While traditional Malabar spinach becomes aggressively vining, ‘Ruby Vine’ maintains a manageable 1-1.5 meter length, making it perfect for trellises and balcony rails while delivering the same succulent texture and mild, citrus-spinach flavor.</p>
