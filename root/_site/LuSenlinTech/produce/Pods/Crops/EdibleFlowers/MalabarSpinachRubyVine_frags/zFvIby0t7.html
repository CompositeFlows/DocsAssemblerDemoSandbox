<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Ruby Vine’ offers a mild, slightly citrusy spinach flavor with hints of pepper and a remarkably succulent, mucilaginous texture that thickens soups and stews. The leaves are thick, heart-shaped, and dark green with striking red veining, while the stems and vines are a vibrant ruby red. The plant exhibits a controlled vining habit, producing lateral branches that create a dense, productive screen.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Heat-Loving Spinach Substitute</strong>
This vine’s unique texture and heat tolerance make it invaluable for summer cooking when traditional spinach fails.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stir-fries and Sautés:</strong> The premier use - quick-cooked with garlic and oil where its mucilaginous quality helps create rich, clinging sauces.</li>
  <li><strong>Summer Soups and Stews:</strong> Added during the final minutes of cooking to provide thickening power and nutrient density without turning slimy.</li>
  <li><strong>Raw in Salads:</strong> Young leaves and stem tips can be used fresh in salads, providing a juicy crunch and mild flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Ornamental Edible Screen:</strong> Grown vertically to create a beautiful, productive privacy screen that thrives in the hottest balcony spots.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Ruby Vine’ is a continuous producer throughout the hottest months. Harvest individual leaves and tender stem tips regularly to encourage branching. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>substantial yield of 150-200g of leaves and tips per week throughout summer, with first harvests possible 50 days after planting.</strong></p>
