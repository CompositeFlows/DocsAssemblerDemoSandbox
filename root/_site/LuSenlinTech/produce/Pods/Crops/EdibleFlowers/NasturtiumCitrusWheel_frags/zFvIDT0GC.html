<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The development of ‘Citrus Wheel’ represents a breakthrough in flavor enhancement and growth habit modification for edible flowers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compact, mounding habit is achieved through selective breeding for a specific dwarfing gene that suppresses the vining tendency typical of nasturtiums while maintaining high leaf and flower production density.</li>
  <li>The unique citrus flavor profile results from enhanced production of limonene and citral compounds alongside the traditional glucosinolates that provide the peppery notes, creating a balanced, complex flavor that is less harsh than wild varieties.</li>
  <li>Its continuous flowering capability is engineered through day-length neutrality and reduced sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, allowing consistent production regardless of seasonal changes on the balcony.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Nasturtium ‘Citrus Wheel’</strong> is a <strong>compact, citrus-infused, and perpetually productive</strong> edible flower, a genetic innovation that transforms the traditional nasturtium into a space-efficient, flavor-forward specialty crop for the urban gourmet.</p>
