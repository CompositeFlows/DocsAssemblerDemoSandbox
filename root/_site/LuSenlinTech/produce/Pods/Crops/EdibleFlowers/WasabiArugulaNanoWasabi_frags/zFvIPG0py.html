<p>‘Nano-Wasabi’ is a groundbreaking dwarf arugula cultivar that delivers the authentic, clean heat of wasabi alongside the classic peppery notes of arugula. This compact variety produces small, rounded, dark green leaves with a unique chemical profile that generates a nasal-clearing sensation strikingly similar to true wasabi, all in a plant that forms a tidy 15-20 cm rosette perfect for container growing. It offers the convenience of fresh wasabi flavor without the challenging cultivation requirements of the traditional Japanese horseradish.</p>
