<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Nano-Wasabi’ delivers an immediate, clean, sharp heat that rises through the nasal passages - the characteristic sensation of true wasabi - followed by the familiar peppery, nutty finish of quality arugula. The leaves are small, rounded, and deep emerald green with a slightly thicker, succulent texture than standard arugula. The plant grows as a dense, uniform rosette that remains compact and productive.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Instant Wasabi Alternative</strong>
This arugula’s unique heat profile makes it invaluable for dishes where true wasabi is desired but impractical.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sushi and Sashimi Companion:</strong> The premier use - a few fresh leaves provide the authentic wasabi experience alongside raw fish, eliminating the need for processed wasabi paste.</li>
  <li><strong>Salad Heat Element:</strong> Adds a surprising, clean heat to salads and slaws that is fundamentally different from chili pepper heat.</li>
  <li><strong>Sandwich and Wrap Accent:</strong> A single leaf can replace mustard or wasabi spread in sandwiches, providing immediate flavor impact.</li>
  <li><strong>Garnish with Punch:</strong> Use as a final garnish on soups, noodles, or rice bowls where the nasal-clearing heat will complement rather than overwhelm.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Nano-Wasabi’ is a cut-and-come-again variety that becomes more potent as it matures. Harvest outer leaves when they reach 5-7 cm in diameter for continuous production. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a <strong>consistent yield of 20-30 pungent leaves per week, with first harvest possible just 25 days after germination.</strong></p>
