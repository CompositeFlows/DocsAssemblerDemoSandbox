<p>‘Methi-Micro’ is an ultra-compact, rapid-cycling fenugreek cultivar specifically engineered for microgreen production and high-density container growing. This dwarf variety produces dense clusters of tender, trifoliate leaves with a concentrated maple-sweet and celery-like flavor, harvested at just 8-12 cm tall. Unlike traditional fenugreek that becomes tough and bitter with age, ‘Methi-Micro’ maintains its delicate texture and complex sweet-bitter balance at the microgreen stage, making it ideal for continuous balcony harvests.</p>
