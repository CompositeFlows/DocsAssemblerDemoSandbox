<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Methi-Micro’ delivers a sophisticated flavor profile beginning with distinct maple syrup sweetness, followed by subtle celery and bitter notes, and finishing with the characteristic fenugreek aroma. The leaves are small, tender, and divided into three rounded leaflets of bright green. The plants grow as uniform, upright microgreens with delicate stems that remain succulent and crisp at harvest size.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Sweet-Bitter Flavor Complex</strong>
This microgreen’s unique flavor combination makes it exceptionally versatile for both traditional and modern culinary applications.</p>

  <li><strong>Grain and Legume Enhancer:</strong> Mixed into rice dishes, dals, and bean salads where its sweet-bitter complexity balances starchy flavors.</li>
  <li><strong>Salad and Sandwich Accent:</strong> Adds a unique flavor dimension to green salads and sandwiches, providing both sweetness and bitter counterpoints.</li>
