<p>‘Crimson Pinch’ is a compact, brilliantly colored strain of Redclaw crayfish (<em>Cherax quadricarinatus</em>) engineered for prolific production in confined aquaponic systems. This cultivar displays the signature vibrant red-orange patches on the outer edges of its claws but in a dwarfed body that reaches a manageable harvest size of 10-12 cm. Selected for reduced aggression and high fecundity, ‘Crimson Pinch’ delivers the sweet, lobster-like flavor and firm texture of standard Redclaw, making it a premium crustacean choice for space-limited cultivation.</p>
