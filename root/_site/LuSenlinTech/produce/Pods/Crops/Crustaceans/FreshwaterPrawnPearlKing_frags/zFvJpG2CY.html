<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Pearl-King’ offers the quintessential freshwater prawn profile: an intensely sweet, rich flavor with clean, briny notes and a firm, almost crunchy texture when properly cooked. The meat is opaque white with a distinctive pink blush after cooking. The prawns themselves are robust, with pronounced royal-blue claws in males and a sleek, pearl-opalescent body that shimmers under light.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Versatile Sweet Crustacean</strong>
This prawn’s robust texture and rich flavor make it suitable for everything from simple grilling to complex sauces.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grilled or BBQ Prawns:</strong> The premier preparation - grilled in the shell to develop a smoky aroma, which protects the delicate meat inside and intensifies its natural sweetness.</li>
  <li><strong>Prawn Scampi or Garlic Butter Sauté:</strong> Served shell-on or peeled, its firm texture holds up to quick sautéing in butter, garlic, and white wine without becoming rubbery.</li>
  <li><strong>Ceviche and Crudo:</strong> Its inherent sweetness and firm structure make it excellent for raw applications, “cooking” gently in citrus juice while retaining a pleasant bite.</li>
  <li><strong>Hearty Curries and Stews:</strong> Adds a luxurious, sweet depth to coconut-based curries and bisques, where its shell can be used to enrich the broth.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘Pearl-King’ exhibits rapid, synchronized growth under optimal warm water conditions (26-30°C). It is less aggressive than standard strains, allowing for higher stocking densities. Reared in an AquaPod or IMTA Shrimp Ring system, a cohort provides a <strong>concentrated, single-harvest yield of 40-60 premium prawns per 50-liter pod, reaching optimal harvest size of 30g in just 10-12 weeks from post-larval stage.</strong></p>
