<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The excellence of ‘Pearl-King’ stems from its accelerated maturation and selected behavioral traits for communal rearing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rapid growth to a specific, moderate size is achieved by selecting for a truncated molt cycle and efficient protein conversion, directing energy into muscle development rather than indefinite growth.</li>
  <li>The reduced aggression and cannibalism are critical traits for high-density culture, achieved by selecting for individuals with lower territoriality and a higher threshold for triggering dominance behaviors.</li>
  <li>The brilliant, pearlescent shell coloration is linked to a robust exoskeleton formation, which reduces mortality during the vulnerable molting period and ensures a higher survival rate to harvest.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Freshwater Prawn ‘Pearl-King’</strong> is a <strong>fast-maturing, flavor-rich, and behaviorally refined</strong> cultivar, a regal crustacean engineered to bring the luxury of freshwater prawn cultivation to the urban aquaculturist’s doorstep.</p>
