<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The excellence of ‘Blue Marronette’ stems from its stabilized pigmentation and selected growth characteristics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The intense, stable blue coloration results from selective breeding for maximum expression of crustacyanin proteins that bind with astaxanthin to create the blue pigment, a trait that has been stabilized across generations.</li>
  <li>The compact size while maintaining excellent meat yield is achieved through selecting for a deep-bodied morphology with a shortened abdomen, concentrating growth in the meat-rich tail section.</li>
  <li>The exceptional sweetness and clean flavor are enhanced by maintaining the crustaceans on a controlled diet free of compounds that can cause off-flavors, while selecting for individuals with efficient nutrient conversion to muscle tissue.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Mini Marron ‘Blue Marronette’</strong> is a <strong>color-stable, flavor-superior, and portion-perfect</strong> cultivar, a premium freshwater crustacean that brings the luxury of Australian marron within practical reach of urban aquaculture while offering breathtaking visual appeal.</p>
