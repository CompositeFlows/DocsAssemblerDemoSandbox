<p>‘Blue Marronette’ is a dwarf, vibrantly colored strain of Australian marron (<em>Cherax cainii</em>) selected for its spectacular appearance and compact size in container aquaculture. This cultivar displays an intense, electric blue coloration across its entire carapace and claws, with some individuals showing subtle violet undertones. Reaching a manageable harvest size of 12-15 cm, ‘Blue Marronette’ delivers the renowned sweet, delicate flavor of premium marron - often described as a cross between lobster and crayfish - in a perfectly portioned format ideal for urban cultivation.</p>
