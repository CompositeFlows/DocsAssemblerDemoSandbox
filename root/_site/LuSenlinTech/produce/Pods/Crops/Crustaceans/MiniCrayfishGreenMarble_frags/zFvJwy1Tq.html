<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The consistency of ‘Green-Marble’ is rooted in its unique reproductive biology and selected morphological traits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The parthenogenetic reproduction ensures every offspring is genetically identical to the parent, guaranteeing consistent marbled patterning, growth rate, and flavor profile across the entire population.</li>
  <li>The dwarf size is a naturally occurring trait in this clonal line that has been stabilized through selective culling of larger variants, creating a population that reliably matures at the desired plate size.</li>
  <li>The vibrant green marbling is the result of selective breeding for specific chromatophore distribution and density, creating the distinctive appearance while maintaining the hardiness required for aquaculture.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Mini Crayfish ‘Green-Marble’</strong> is a <strong>self-sustaining, visually striking, and flavor-authentic</strong> cultivar, a clonal marvel that provides both endless fascination and a reliable harvest of sweet, succulent crustacean meat from a compact urban system.</p>
