<p>‘CleanSweep Urban’ is a robust, hard-working strain of Amano shrimp (<em>Caridina multidentata</em>) selected specifically for superior algae-cleaning performance in the controlled environment of an urban aquaponic system. This cultivar maintains the classic translucent gray-green body with a distinctive dashed-line pattern but has been bred for increased size, bolder grazing behavior, and greater resilience to parameter fluctuations. While primarily deployed as the ultimate clean-up crew, mature specimens reach a substantial 5-6 cm, offering a firm, savory protein bonus.</p>
