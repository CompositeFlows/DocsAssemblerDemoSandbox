<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘CleanSweep Urban’ offers a deep, savory, almost oceanic flavor with a firm, substantial texture. Its flavor is more robust and less sweet than Neocaridina species, with a pronounced umami character. The meat is opaque and firm, requiring slightly longer cooking times. The shrimp themselves are larger and more active than typical ornamental cleaners, with a powerful, constant grazing motion that makes them exceptionally efficient.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Savory, Substantial Bonus Harvest</strong>
This shrimp’s larger size and savory profile make it suitable for dishes where a more pronounced shellfish flavor is desired.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Shrimp Stock and Broth:</strong> The premier use - the shells and bodies create an incredibly rich, deeply flavored stock, ideal as a base for risottos, soups, and sauces.</li>
  <li><strong>Stir-fried in Shell:</strong> Sautéed quickly with strong flavors like black bean sauce, chili, and garlic; the shell imparts immense flavor to the oil and sauce.</li>
  <li><strong>Boiled and Peeled:</strong> A simple boil yields firm, flavorful meat that can be used in salads, pasta dishes, or fried rice.</li>
  <li><strong>Fermented Shrimp Paste:</strong> Their potent flavor makes them an excellent candidate for creating high-quality, homemade shrimp paste or fermented shrimp sauce.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest &amp; Growth Cycle</strong>
‘CleanSweep Urban’ is a dedicated workhorse, constantly grazing on filamentous algae and biofilm. They do not breed in freshwater, so the population is stable and managed by the cultivator. In a mature AquaPod or planted system, a crew of 10-15 adults provides <strong>continuous algae control, with the option to harvest the largest individuals every 3-4 months as they reach their maximum size of 5-6 cm.</strong></p>
