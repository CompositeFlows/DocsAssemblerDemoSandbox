<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Metro-Needle’ offers a delicate, slightly sweet and fruity flavor with a clean, crisp bite. The caps are small, honey-gold to amber-brown, and convex, topping slender, wiry stems that are pale tan and develop a characteristic velvety texture at the base. The mushrooms grow in dense, upright clusters resembling a miniature forest, with stems reaching 8-12 cm in height - long and elegant, yet sturdier than commercially forced varieties.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Delicate Crunch &amp; Soup Specialist</strong>
This mushroom’s unique texture and mild flavor make it ideal for dishes where subtlety and mouthfeel are paramount.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hot Pot and Soup Essential:</strong> The premier use - added to miso soup, ramen, or hot pots during the final moments of cooking, where they wilt slightly but retain a pleasant, al dente crunch.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads and Crudité:</strong> Raw, young clusters can be separated and added to salads for a crisp, mild mushroom flavor and elegant appearance.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick Sauté or Stir-fry:</strong> Cooked very briefly over high heat to preserve their crisp-tender texture, perfect for noodle dishes and vegetable sautés.</li>
  <li><strong>Garnish with Texture:</strong> Used as a delicate, edible garnish for soups and Asian-inspired dishes, providing both visual appeal and a subtle crunch.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Metro-Needle’ is a cool-weather fruiter that produces abundant clusters. Harvest entire clusters by twisting at the base when the majority of caps are open but before the stems become tough. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a <strong>prolific yield of numerous dense clusters totaling 300–500g, with fruiting typically occurring in flushes during cooler temperatures, 14-20 days after initiation.</strong></p>
