<p>‘Gold Thread’ is a high-potency, compact-fruiting strain of <em>Cordyceps militaris</em> specifically optimized for cultivation on nutrient-enriched rice substrate blocks in container environments. This cultivar produces vibrant, golden-orange, club-shaped fruiting bodies that emerge like miniature scepters from the substrate, closely mimicking the form and color of its wild counterparts. Bred for maximum cordycepin and adenosine yield in a confined space, ‘Gold Thread’ is a functional mushroom powerhouse, cultivated for its dense concentration of bioactive compounds rather than its minimal culinary appeal.</p>
