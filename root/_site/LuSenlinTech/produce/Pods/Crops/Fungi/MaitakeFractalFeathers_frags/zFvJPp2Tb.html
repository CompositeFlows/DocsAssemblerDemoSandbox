<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Fractal Feathers’ offers the complex, savory Maitake profile: an deeply earthy, umami-rich base with a distinctive spicy-peppery aroma and a rich, almost chicken-like undertone. The individual caps are small, thin, and soft, typically 2-4 cm across, with a silky-gray to brownish upper surface and a pure white underside. They grow in tight, rosette-like clusters that mimic the layered structure of a wild specimen, but on a scale rarely exceeding 15 cm in diameter.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Savory, Aromatic All-Rounder</strong>
This mushroom’s robust flavor and unique, tender-firm texture make it exceptionally versatile.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sautéed or Seared:</strong> The premier method - torn into pieces and sautéed over high heat to develop a crispy, caramelized exterior while the interior remains juicy and tender, maximizing its savory flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Soup and Stock Base:</strong> Adds an unparalleled depth of flavor and rich, earthy aroma to broths, stocks, and ramen.</li>
  <li><strong>Grain and Stuffing Mix-in:</strong> Torn and mixed into wild rice, quinoa, or bread stuffings, where it contributes moisture and a profound savory character.</li>
  <li><strong>“Pulled” Mushroom Applications:</strong> The tender, fibrous texture of the cluster base can be shredded to create a fantastic plant-based “pulled” meat for sandwiches and tacos.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Fractal Feathers’ is a slow but immensely rewarding colonizer, fruiting in response to a significant drop in temperature. Harvest the entire cluster at the base when the edges of the individual caps are still slightly curled under and the fruiting body feels firm and heavy for its size. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it typically provides <strong>one substantial, central cluster weighing 400–700g, with the potential for a smaller secondary flush, maturing 3-5 weeks after the temperature trigger.</strong></p>
