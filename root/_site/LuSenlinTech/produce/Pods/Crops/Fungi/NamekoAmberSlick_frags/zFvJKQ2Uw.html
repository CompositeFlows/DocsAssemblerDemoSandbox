<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Amber Slick’ offers a rich, earthy, and slightly nutty flavor with a distinct umami depth that forms the foundation of many Japanese dishes. The caps are small (2-4 cm), smooth, and range from honey-amber to rusty brown, topped with a thick, clear gelatinous layer. The stems are slender and firm, supporting clusters of mushrooms that glisten as if freshly glazed. The texture is the defining feature - slippery and smooth when cooked, yet retaining a pleasant firmness.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Essential Japanese Soup Mushroom</strong>
This mushroom’s unique texture and foundational flavor make it indispensable for specific traditional and modern applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Miso Soup and Nabe:</strong> The premier use - added to miso soup, nabe (hot pot), and ramen where its slippery texture and rich flavor are considered essential, thickening the broth slightly as it cooks.</li>
  <li><strong>Soba and Udon Topping:</strong> Simmered in a soy-based sauce (nameko no tsukudani) and served over noodles, providing a savory, glutinous topping.</li>
  <li><strong>Rice and Donburi:</strong> Mixed into steamed rice or served over rice bowls (donburi), where its gelatinous quality adds moisture and binds ingredients.</li>
  <li><strong>Tempura:</strong> Lightly battered and fried, creating a contrast between the crisp exterior and the uniquely soft, slippery interior.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Amber Slick’ fruits in dense, picturesque clusters in cool, humid conditions. Harvest entire clusters when the caps are fully formed and the gelatinous layer is most prominent. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a <strong>moderate but high-quality yield of 300–500g of glossy, authentic Nameko over 2-3 flushes, with the first harvest ready 14-20 days after initiating fruiting conditions.</strong></p>
