<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Candy-Cap’ offers a powerful, complex flavor profile: an initial rich, smoky ham-like savoriness followed by subtle shrimp-like sweetness and a firm, meaty texture that stands up to high-heat cooking. The caps are firm, thick-fleshed, and maintain their vibrant pink-orange color through harvest, fading only slightly when fully mature. They grow in large, beautiful clusters that provide both visual drama and substantial yield.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Bold Flavor Specialist</strong>
This mushroom’s intense flavor and sturdy texture make it ideal for dishes where it can be the star ingredient.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Seafood Substitute:</strong> The premier use - sliced and seared as a stunning, flavorful substitute for scallops or shrimp, where its color and seafood-like sweetness shine.</li>
  <li><strong>Bacon Alternative:</strong> Thinly sliced and baked or pan-fried until crisp, it creates a vibrant, smoky vegan “bacon” with remarkable flavor depth.</li>
  <li><strong>Grilled and Barbecued:</strong> Its firm flesh holds up perfectly on the grill, developing a delicious char without falling apart.</li>
  <li><strong>Rich Stocks and Bisques:</strong> Adds a deep, reddish color and profound umami to broths, perfect for seafood bisques or ramen.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Candy-Cap’ is a rapid, heat-tolerant fruiter that performs exceptionally well in warm balcony conditions. Harvest when clusters are full but caps are still convex and brightly colored. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a <strong>fast, heavy yield of 500–800g of vibrant pink mushrooms in its first flush, with fruits maturing rapidly in 5-7 days after pinning, often producing a substantial second flush.</strong></p>
