<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The reliability of ‘Pearl-Fog’ is rooted in its robust genetics and environmental tolerance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its exceptional adaptability to lower and less stable humidity levels (as low as 65-70%) is due to selective breeding for strains with a thicker, more hydrophobic cap cuticle, which reduces water loss in the dry air typical of balcony environments.</li>
  <li>The fast colonization and pinning are a result of selecting for a highly aggressive rhizomorphic mycelial network that efficiently dominates the substrate and responds quickly to the temperature drop and fresh air exchange that trigger fruiting.</li>
  <li>The consistent, classic form and flavour are maintained by stabilizing the genetic expression of the enzymes responsible for the development of the signature oyster mushroom aroma compounds, ensuring a predictable culinary result with every harvest.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Oyster ‘Pearl-Fog’</strong> is a <strong>resilient, high-yielding, and flavour-classic</strong> cultivar, a foundational mushroom strain that guarantees success and a bountiful harvest for the balcony mushroom grower.</p>
