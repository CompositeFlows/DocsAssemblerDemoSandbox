<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Pearl-Fog’ offers the classic, versatile oyster mushroom profile: a mild, sweet, and nutty flavour with a hint of licorice or anise on the nose. The caps are smooth, tongue-shaped, and range from pale dove-gray to soft slate, growing in dense, overlapping clusters. The flesh is tender yet resilient, with a velvety texture that holds up well to cooking without becoming slimy.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Culinary Workhorse</strong>
This mushroom’s mild but distinctive flavour and excellent texture make it incredibly adaptable in the kitchen.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sautéed or Stir-fried:</strong> The premier method - quickly cooked over high heat with garlic and butter or oil, where it develops a beautiful sear and its sweet, nutty notes are enhanced.</li>
  <li><strong>Soups and Stews:</strong> Adds a rich, savory depth to broths and creamy soups, contributing umami without overpowering other ingredients.</li>
  <li><strong>“Pulled” Meat Substitute:</strong> The fibrous texture of the larger caps makes them ideal for shredding and braising, creating a satisfying plant-based alternative for sandwiches and tacos.</li>
  <li><strong>Tempura and Frying:</strong> Its delicate flesh and ability to hold a light batter make it excellent for frying, resulting in a crisp exterior and tender interior.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Pearl-Fog’ is a rapid and prolific fruiter. Harvest entire clusters by twisting gently at the base when the caps are still slightly curled under but have fully expanded; avoid waiting until the edges flatten completely. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a <strong>substantial and reliable yield of 600–900g of fresh mushrooms over 2-3 heavy flushes, with the first harvest ready for picking just 10-14 days after initiating fruiting conditions.</strong></p>
