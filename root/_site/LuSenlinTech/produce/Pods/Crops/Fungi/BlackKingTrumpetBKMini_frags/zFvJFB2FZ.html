<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘BK-Mini’ offers a profound, rich umami flavor with earthy, almost wine-like notes and a hint of black truffle. The caps are small, 3-5 cm in diameter, and range from dark gray to nearly black, while the stems are thick, dense, and pure white inside, growing 5-8 cm tall. The entire fruiting body has an exceptionally firm, low-moisture texture from cap to stem base.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Meaty Texture Specialist</strong>
This mushroom’s extraordinary density and rich flavor make it ideal for applications where it can mimic or replace meat.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scallop and Steak Substitute:</strong> Sliced thickly across the stem to create medallions that sear beautifully, developing a crust while maintaining a tender, juicy interior similar to scallops or beef.</li>
  <li><strong>Grilled and Barbecued:</strong> Holds its shape perfectly on the grill, developing a smoky char without becoming tough or rubbery.</li>
  <li><strong>Slow-Cooked and Braised:</strong> Its dense structure allows it to be braised for long periods, absorbing flavors while retaining a satisfying, meaty bite.</li>
  <li><strong>Shaved Raw:</strong> The stems can be shaved paper-thin on a mandoline for a dramatic, flavorful addition to salads and crudi.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘BK-Mini’ is a reliable, moderate-speed fruiter that produces dense, heavy clusters. Harvest when the caps are still slightly incurred but the stems have thickened substantially. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a <strong>substantial yield by weight of 400–600g of incredibly dense mushrooms over 2 flushes, with the first harvest ready 12-16 days after initiating fruiting conditions.</strong></p>
