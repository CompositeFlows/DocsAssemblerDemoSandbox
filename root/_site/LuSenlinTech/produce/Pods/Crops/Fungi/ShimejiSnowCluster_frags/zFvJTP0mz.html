<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The purity of ‘Snow Cluster’ stems from its stable albino characteristics and optimized growth structure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The consistent, bright white coloration is a result of a selected mutation that suppresses melanin production in the fruiting body, a trait that has been stabilized to prevent reversion to pigmented forms.</li>
  <li>Its sweet, nutty flavor profile, distinct from the slightly bitter notes of some brown shimeji, is linked to a different balance of free amino acids and a lower concentration of certain terpenoids, achieved through targeted selective breeding.</li>
  <li>The ability to form such dense, uniform clusters is a trait selected for efficient resource allocation, ensuring the mycelial network initiates a high number of primordia in a synchronized manner, leading to the characteristic “bouquet” appearance.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Shimeji ‘Snow Cluster’</strong> is a <strong>mild, crisp, and visually pristine</strong> gourmet mushroom, a refined cultivar that offers a cleaner, sweeter alternative to traditional shimeji, perfect for elevating the urban gourmet’s palette with both its beauty and its subtle, sophisticated flavor.</p>
