<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Snow Cluster’ delivers a delicate, sweet, and nutty flavor with hints of fresh almond and a clean, buttery finish. The caps are small (1-3 cm), perfectly convex, and pure alabaster white, while the stems are slender, crisp, and similarly pale. The mushrooms grow in remarkably dense, uniform clusters where dozens of individual fruits emerge from a common base, resembling a miniature, upright bouquet. The texture is consistently firm and crisp, never slimy.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Delicate, Versatile Performer</strong>
This shimeji’s mild sweetness and firm texture make it exceptionally adaptable, capable of enhancing dishes without overpowering them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stir-fries and Sautés:</strong> A premier use - added during the final minutes of cooking to preserve its crisp-tender texture and subtle nutty sweetness, perfect for Asian-inspired vegetable medleys.</li>
  <li><strong>Creamy Pastas and Risottos:</strong> Its mild flavor and firm bite make it an excellent addition to creamy sauces, where it adds texture without competing with delicate flavors.</li>
  <li><strong>Tempura and Light Frying:</strong> The small, uniform size and crisp texture are ideal for tempura, creating delicate, non-greasy morsels with a sweet, nutty interior.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads and Garnishes:</strong> Very young, tender clusters can be separated and used raw in salads for a mild, crunchy element, or used whole as an elegant plate garnish.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Snow Cluster’ is a reliable, moderate-speed fruiter that produces abundant, picturesque clusters. Harvest by twisting the entire dense cluster from the substrate when the majority of caps are convex and the stems are firm. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a <strong>substantial yield of multiple clusters totaling 400–700g over 2-3 flushes, with the first harvest ready 12-18 days after initiating fruiting conditions.</strong></p>
