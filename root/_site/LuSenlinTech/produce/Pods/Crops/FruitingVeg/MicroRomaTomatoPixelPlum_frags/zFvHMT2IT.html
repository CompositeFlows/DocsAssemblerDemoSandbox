<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Pixel-Plum’ offers a highly concentrated, classic Roma flavour: intensely rich and tangy with low juiciness and very high solids content. The fruits are small, plum-shaped, and weigh 15-20 grams each, with a thick, robust skin that protects the dense, nearly seedless, meaty interior. The plant is a true micro-dwarf, forming a dense, dark green mound that rarely exceeds 25 cm in height.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Sauce &amp; Preservation Specialist</strong>
This tomato’s culinary value is defined by its exceptional dry matter content, making it inefficient for fresh salads but peerless for processing.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Concentrated Sauces &amp; Pastes:</strong> Its high pectin and solid content mean it reduces into a thick, deeply flavoured sauce or paste in half the time of standard tomatoes, with an unparalleled rich, tangy taste.</li>
  <li><strong>Oven-Drying &amp; Dehydrating:</strong> The perfect tomato for making balcony “sun-dried” tomatoes in a dehydrator or low oven. Its meaty flesh dehydrates quickly into a chewy, flavour-packed treat.</li>
  <li><strong>Stuffed Appetizers:</strong> The small, firm, and hollow-friendly shape makes them ideal for roasting or grilling whole when stuffed with herbs, cheese, or grains.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
As a determinate micro-dwarf, ‘Pixel-Plum’ sets a massive, synchronized crop. The plant becomes a single, prolific unit of ripening fruit. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant delivers a <strong>surprisingly heavy yield of 0.8–1.2 kg of dense, meaty fruits, with the entire harvest ripening uniformly within a 10-day window, approximately 65 days from transplant.</strong></p>
