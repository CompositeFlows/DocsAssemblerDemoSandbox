<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Short-Long’ offers the distinct, slightly earthy and sweet flavor of a yard-long bean, with a denser, meatier texture than a common green bean. The pods are deep green, incredibly slender, and hang in pairs and triplets from the bushy foliage. The plant forms a dense, rounded mound approximately 50 cm tall and wide, requiring no trellis and resembling an ornamental shrub when in production.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Stir-Fry and Braising Specialist</strong>
This bean’s robust structure and unique flavor make it a star in cooked applications, particularly in Asian cuisine.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stir-fries and Sautés:</strong> Its firm texture holds up excellently to high-heat cooking, absorbing flavors from sauces and aromatics like garlic and ginger without becoming mushy.</li>
  <li><strong>Long-Braised Dishes:</strong> A key ingredient in braised dishes and curries, where its meaty texture softens beautifully while maintaining structural integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Steamed and Salads:</strong> Can be briefly steamed until tender-crisp and tossed in salads, or blanched and dressed with sesame oil and soy for a classic side dish.</li>
  <li><strong>Pickled and Preserved:</strong> Young, tender pods can be pickled whole, creating a crisp, tangy condiment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Short-Long’ is a continuous and prolific producer throughout the warm season. For the best texture and flavor, harvest pods when they are young, slender, and before the seeds inside begin to bulge. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>sustained and heavy yield, producing dozens of long, slender pods over the season, with the first harvest ready approximately 60 days from transplant.</strong></p>
