<p>‘City-Zuke’ is a revolutionary open-bush zucchini that shatters the myth that prolific squash require sprawling garden space. This meticulously bred dwarf cultivar produces a high yield of classic, dark green, cylindrical fruits from a compact, non-vining plant that occupies a fraction of the area of traditional varieties. ‘City-Zuke’ delivers the same tender flesh and mild, nutty flavour of its larger cousins, making summer squash harvests possible on the smallest balcony or patio.</p>
