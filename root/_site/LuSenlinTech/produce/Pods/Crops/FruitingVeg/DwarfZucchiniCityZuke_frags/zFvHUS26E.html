<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘City-Zuke’ offers the quintessential, versatile zucchini flavour: a mild, slightly sweet and nutty profile that readily absorbs other flavours. The fruits are a deep emerald green, straight, and glossy, typically growing to 15-18 cm in length while remaining tender and seedless. The plant’s form is its key innovation - a dense, open bush with short internodes and upright leaves, reaching only 45 cm in diameter and requiring no trailing.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Compact Summer Squash Workhorse</strong>
This zucchini’s value is in its space efficiency and classic culinary performance.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grilled or Sautéed:</strong> Sliced into rounds or planks, it grills and sautés beautifully, developing a sweet, caramelized exterior while staying firm and tender.</li>
  <li><strong>Zucchini Noodles (“Zoodles”):</strong> Its straight, uniform shape and firm texture make it ideal for spiralizing into a low-carb, gluten-free pasta alternative.</li>
  <li><strong>Baking and Fritters:</strong> Grated, it is perfect for moist zucchini bread, muffins, or crispy fritters, where its mild flavour acts as a perfect canvas for spices and herbs.</li>
  <li><strong>Stuffed Zucchini Boats:</strong> The smaller, tender fruits are excellent for halving and stuffing with grains, meats, and cheeses for a complete meal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘City-Zuke’ is a continuously productive plant. For the best texture and flavour, harvest fruits frequently when they are young and skin is still glossy. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>surprisingly abundant and steady yield, producing 8-12 tender fruits over the main season, with the first harvest ready for picking approximately 50 days from transplant.</strong></p>
