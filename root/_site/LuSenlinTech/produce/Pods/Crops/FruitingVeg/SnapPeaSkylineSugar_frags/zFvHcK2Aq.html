<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Skyline Sugar’ offers an explosive, sugary sweetness with a clean, crisp crunch. The pods are plump, brightly green, and virtually stringless, encasing tender, well-developed peas. The entire pod is edible at any stage. The plant itself is a architectural wonder, forming a narrow, upright column of foliage that reaches 40-45 cm in height and is densely packed with pods held conveniently out in the open for easy picking.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Snack and Stir-fry Pea</strong>
This pea’s perfect texture and sugary taste make it incredibly versatile, shining both raw and cooked.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Garden-Side Snacking:</strong> The ultimate raw treat, eaten straight from the plant. Its thick, juicy walls provide an unparalleled crunchy-sweet experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads and Crudité:</strong> A star ingredient in salads, adding a burst of sweetness and colour, or served whole on a vegetable platter.</li>
  <li><strong>Stir-fries and Sautés:</strong> Its robust pod structure holds up beautifully to quick, high-heat cooking, retaining a vibrant colour and satisfying snap while absorbing savoury sauces.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick-Pickled:</strong> Can be lightly pickled in a sweet brine to create a crisp, refreshing refrigerator pickle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Skyline Sugar’ is a concentrated, determinate-type producer, yielding its main crop over a generous 3-4 week period. For the best flavour and texture, harvest pods when they are plump and glossy but before the peas inside become overly prominent. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a <strong>bountiful and convenient yield of 30-50 crisp pods per plant, with the first harvest ready in approximately 60 days from sowing.</strong></p>
