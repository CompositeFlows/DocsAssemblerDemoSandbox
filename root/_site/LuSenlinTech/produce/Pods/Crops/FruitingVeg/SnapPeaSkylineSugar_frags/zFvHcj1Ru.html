<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The innovation of ‘Skyline Sugar’ lies in its revolutionary plant architecture and enhanced sugar metabolism.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compact, self-supporting columnar form is due to a modified <em>afila</em> gene, which converts leaves into tendrils that grip adjacent stems for support, combined with a dwarfing gene that creates short, strong internodes. This creates a dense, interwoven plant that supports its own heavy fruit load.</li>
  <li>The intense sweetness and crispness are a result of selecting for a high concentration of soluble solids (sugars) within the pod walls and a delayed conversion of sugars to starch post-harvest. The pod walls also have a reinforced cellulose structure, providing the signature crunch without fibrousness.</li>
  <li>Its high yield in a small volume is achieved by selecting for a high number of flowering nodes and a shortened juvenile phase, allowing the plant to rapidly transition from vegetative growth to prolific pod production.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Snap Pea ‘Skyline Sugar’</strong> is a <strong>space-smart, super-sweet, and self-supporting</strong> variety, a genetic masterpiece that condenses the abundant harvest and classic flavour of a pea patch into a sleek, balcony-friendly column.</p>
