<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The success of ‘Sun-Dot’ lies in its genetic mastery of compact growth and flavour concentration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its determinate, bushy habit is controlled by a specific expression of the “self-pruning” gene. This gene causes the plant to terminate its own vertical growth naturally, directing all photosynthetic energy into fruit production rather than vines, resulting in a stunningly productive, compact plant.</li>
  <li>The intense, balanced flavour is a product of selecting for a specific volatile organic compound (VOC) profile. ‘Sun-Dot’ has been bred for high levels of geranial (which provides a sweet, floral note) and a favourable sugar-to-acid ratio, ensuring sweetness is complemented by a clean, bright tang, not overwhelming acidity.</li>
  <li>Its exceptionally high fruit-to-foliage ratio is achieved through a modified leaf morphology. The leaves are smaller and more upright, reducing shading and allowing maximum light penetration to the developing fruit trusses, which encourages uniform ripening and superior sugar accumulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Patio Cherry Tomato ‘Sun-Dot’</strong> is a <strong>compact, flavour-bursting, and bountiful</strong> variety, a genetic marvel that packages the prolific yield and perfect taste of a summer tomato into a petite, patio-perfect form.</p>
