<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Sun-Dot’ delivers an explosion of classic, balanced tomato flavour: a bright, tangy sweetness with low acidity and a rich, aromatic finish. The fruits are 2-3 cm in diameter, with a firm, glossy skin that gives way to a juicy, seed-filled interior. The plant itself is a compact, bushy powerhouse, rarely exceeding 40 cm in height and width, making it an ideal candidate for pots and fabric towers.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Snacking Tomato</strong>
This tomato’s perfect balance of sweetness and tang makes it incredibly versatile, but it truly shines in its simplest forms.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fresh Off the Vine:</strong> The ultimate garden snack. Their firm texture and burst-in-your-mouth juiciness make them irresistible for fresh eating.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads &amp; Skewers:</strong> Whole or halved, they add vibrant colour and a sweet-tart pop to salads, caprese skewers, and grain bowls.</li>
  <li><strong>Concentrated Sauces:</strong> Due to their high brix (sugar content) and balanced acidity, ‘Sun-Dot’ tomatoes cook down into an intensely flavoured, sweet and rich pasta sauce or soup base.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick-Pickled Treat:</strong> Their firm skin holds up beautifully to quick-pickling in a sweet brine, creating a delightful refrigerator pickle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
As a determinate variety, ‘Sun-Dot’ sets and ripens its fruit in a generous, synchronized wave over a 2-3 week period. This makes it perfect for a planned harvest. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>bountiful, one-time yield of 1.5–2 kg of flawless, sun-ripened cherries, with the entire crop ready for harvest just 60 days from transplant.</strong></p>
