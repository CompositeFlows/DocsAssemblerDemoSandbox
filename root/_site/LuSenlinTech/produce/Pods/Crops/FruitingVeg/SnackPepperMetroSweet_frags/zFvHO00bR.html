<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Metro-Sweet’ offers a classic, sugary-sweet bell pepper flavour with zero heat and crisp, juicy flesh. The fruits are small, typically 5-7 cm long, with a thick, succulent wall that provides a satisfying crunch. The plant itself is sturdy and bushy, reaching only 35-40 cm in height, and is remarkably productive, laden with peppers that stand upright above the foliage.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ultimate Fresh Snack and Salad Topper</strong>
This pepper’s primary virtue is its flawless performance as a fresh, ready-to-eat vegetable.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Garden-Side Snacking:</strong> The perfect size and sweetness for eating whole and raw, straight from the plant. Its thick walls make it incredibly juicy and refreshing.</li>
  <li><strong>Colorful Crunch in Salads:</strong> Diced or sliced into rings, it adds a brilliant pop of red and a burst of sweet crunch to green salads, grain bowls, and salsas.</li>
  <li><strong>Stuffed Appetizers:</strong> Its small, blocky shape is ideal for creating single-bite appetizers when stuffed with cheese, grains, or seasoned meats.</li>
  <li><strong>Skewers and Stir-fries:</strong> Holds its shape and sweet flavour perfectly when briefly grilled on kebabs or quickly tossed into a stir-fry.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Metro-Sweet’ is a prolific, continuous-bearing plant throughout the warm season. Harvest begins with green peppers and continues as they ripen to their full, sweet red stage. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>steady and generous yield, producing 15-25 thick-walled, mini-peppers over the main season, with fruits ready for harvest approximately 75 days from transplant.</strong></p>
