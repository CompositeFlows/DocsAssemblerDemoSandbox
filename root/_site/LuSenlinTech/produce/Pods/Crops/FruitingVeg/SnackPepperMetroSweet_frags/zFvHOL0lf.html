<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The development of ‘Metro-Sweet’ focused on overcoming the common trade-off between compact plant size and fruit quality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its dwarf stature is achieved through a specific brassinosteroid hormone regulation, which limits internode elongation without compromising the plant’s vascular system, allowing for efficient nutrient transport to the developing fruits.</li>
  <li>The signature thickness of the fruit wall (pericarp) is a result of selecting for enhanced cell division and expansion within the ovary wall, a trait often linked to larger plants. ‘Metro-Sweet’ decouples this trait from plant size.</li>
  <li>The intense sweetness is linked to a high fructose-to-chlorogenic-acid ratio. Chlorogenic acid is a compound that can contribute a slight bitterness in some peppers; by selecting for lower levels, the breeders allow the pepper’s natural sugars to shine through without any harsh aftertaste.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Snack Pepper ‘Metro-Sweet’</strong> is a <strong>prolific, sugary, and perfectly-portioned</strong> bell pepper, a genetic triumph that packs the full flavour and texture of a field-grown giant into a patio-friendly plant designed for endless fresh snacking.</p>
