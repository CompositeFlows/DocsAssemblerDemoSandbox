<p>‘Metro-Sweet’ is a compact, high-yielding bell pepper bred specifically for the urban gardener’s need for quick, sweet, and abundant fruits. This dwarf plant produces a heavy canopy of miniature, blocky peppers that mature from a glossy pale green to a vibrant fire-engine red. Unlike many compact varieties, ‘Metro-Sweet’ delivers the full, thick-walled, and intensely sweet flavour of a full-sized bell pepper, but in a personal-sized snack format perfect for container life.</p>
