<p>‘Honey-Drop’ is a groundbreaking, truly compact vining melon that conquers the challenge of growing sweet, full-sized melons in vertical urban spaces. This mini honeydew cultivar produces a limited number of perfectly spherical, personal-sized melons, each weighing 400-500 grams, on a short-vined, well-behaved plant. It delivers the classic, refreshingly sweet and pale green flesh of a honeydew, but with a more concentrated flavour and a fragrance that defines high summer on the balcony.</p>
