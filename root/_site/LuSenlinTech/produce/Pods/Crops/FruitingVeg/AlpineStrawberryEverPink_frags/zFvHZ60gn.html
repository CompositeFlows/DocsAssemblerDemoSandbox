<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The uniqueness of ‘EverPink’ is a direct result of manipulating the biochemical pathways for both colour and flavour.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distinctive pink colour is caused by a partial suppression of the anthocyanin production pathway in the fruit’s flesh and skin, specifically a down-regulation of the genes that produce pelargonidin (the pigment responsible for classic red colour), allowing other carotenoid pigments (yellows and pinks) to show through.</li>
  <li>The novel pineapple-rose flavour is a result of an altered volatile compound profile. ‘EverPink’ produces high levels of furaneol (which provides a caramel-like, tropical note) and geraniol (a rose-scented compound), while maintaining a lower acidity than its wild ancestors.</li>
  <li>Its tidy, clumping habit and continuous flowering are hallmarks of the alpine strawberry species, but ‘EverPink’ has been further selected for larger fruit size and greater flower production to enhance its ornamental and culinary appeal.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Alpine Strawberry ‘EverPink’</strong> is a <strong>fragrant, pastel-hued, and everbearing</strong> fruit, a delicate gourmet specialty that provides a season-long harvest of uniquely flavoured, beautiful berries for the discerning urban gardener.</p>
