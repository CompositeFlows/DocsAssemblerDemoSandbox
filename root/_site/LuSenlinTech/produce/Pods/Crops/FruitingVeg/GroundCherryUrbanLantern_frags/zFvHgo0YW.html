<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The appeal of ‘Urban Lantern’ is rooted in its improved plant habit and stabilized flavour chemistry.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compact, mounding form is a result of selective breeding for shorter internodes and a more determinate growth pattern than its weedy, sprawling relatives, making it perfectly suited for container life.</li>
  <li>The complex tropical flavour is a specific volatile compound profile, including high levels of methyl anthranilate (imparting a grape-like note) and various lactones that contribute to the pineapple and coconut aromas. Breeding has stabilized this profile for consistency.</li>
  <li>The reliable fruit drop is a key domesticated trait. While all ground cherries abscise when ripe, ‘Urban Lantern’ has been selected for a more synchronized ripening and a stronger stem connection that prevents premature dropping, ensuring the fruits are perfectly ripe when they fall.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Ground Cherry ‘Urban Lantern’</strong> is a <strong>prolific, self-harvesting, and tropically sweet</strong> fruit, a delightful and low-maintenance specialty crop that brings the joy of foraging and the taste of the tropics to the urban gardener’s doorstep.</p>
