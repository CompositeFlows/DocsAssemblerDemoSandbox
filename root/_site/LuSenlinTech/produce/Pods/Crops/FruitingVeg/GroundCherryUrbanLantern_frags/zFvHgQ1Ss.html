<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Urban Lantern’ offers a complex and captivating flavour that is a unique blend of pineapple, strawberry, and vanilla, with a distinctively sweet and tropical profile. The berries are small, marble-sized, and a warm apricot-gold when ripe, encased in a papery, beige husk. The plant forms a tidy, mounding bush 40-50 cm in height and spread, with slightly velvety, heart-shaped leaves and a prolific habit of fruiting along its stems.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Self-Harvesting Tropical Treasure</strong>
This ground cherry’s primary value is as a gourmet fresh-eating fruit, with its unique flavour making it a special treat.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fresh Dessert Fruit:</strong> The ultimate way to enjoy it is straight from the husk. Its tropical, candy-like sweetness makes it a perfect healthy dessert or snack.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads and Salsas:</strong> Adds a burst of sweet, tropical flavour to green salads, fruit salads, or especially salsas, where it pairs beautifully with tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.</li>
  <li><strong>Preserves and Compotes:</strong> Its high pectin content and unique flavour make it ideal for creating exquisite jams, chutneys, and compotes.</li>
  <li><strong>Decorative Dessert Topper:</strong> Use the husk-on fruits as a stunning and edible garnish for cakes, tarts, and cheesecakes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Urban Lantern’ features a unique and effortless harvest mechanism. The fruits are ready when the papery husk turns from green to a dry, beige colour and the berry inside becomes a golden-orange. Ripe fruits will naturally detach and drop to the ground, hence the name. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>steady, abundant yield over many weeks, often producing several hundred berries per season. Simply collect the fallen “lanterns” daily for the freshest harvest.</strong></p>
