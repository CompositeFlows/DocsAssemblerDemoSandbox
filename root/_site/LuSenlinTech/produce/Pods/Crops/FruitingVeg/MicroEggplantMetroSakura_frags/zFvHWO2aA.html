<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘Metro-Sakura’ offers a surprisingly delicate and sweet flavour with none of the astringency or bitterness often associated with larger eggplants. The fruits are small, oblong, and perfectly portioned, typically 5-7 cm long, with a stunning, glossy lavender-pink skin and creamy white interior. The plant itself is a compact, bushy specimen, rarely exceeding 40 cm in height and width, with a graceful, ornamental habit.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Gourmet Single-Serving Specialty</strong>
This eggplant’s beauty and mildness make it ideal for elegant, simple preparations where its form and flavour can shine.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Whole-Roasted or Grilled:</strong> Its small size and tender skin make it perfect for roasting or grilling whole. The flesh becomes custardy and sweet, ideal for serving as a single side dish.</li>
  <li><strong>Pickled and Preserved:</strong> The beautiful color and firm texture hold up superbly in quick-pickle brines, creating a stunning and delicious condiment.</li>
  <li><strong>Sautéed and in Stir-fries:</strong> Can be cooked whole or halved in minutes, absorbing sauces beautifully without falling apart.</li>
  <li><strong>The Centerpiece:</strong> Its exquisite appearance makes it a natural focal point in a vegetable medley or as an edible garnish for plating.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘Metro-Sakura’ is a prolific and early-bearing plant. Harvest the fruits as soon as the skin becomes glossy and firm for the best texture and sweetness. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>continuous and decorative yield of 15-25 flawless mini-eggplants over the season, with the first harvest ready in just 55 days from transplant.</strong></p>
