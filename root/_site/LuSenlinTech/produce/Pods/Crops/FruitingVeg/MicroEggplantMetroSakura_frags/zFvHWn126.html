<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The allure of ‘Metro-Sakura’ is a product of targeted breeding for aesthetics, flavour chemistry, and compact form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The unique lavender-pink pigmentation is due to a carefully balanced expression of anthocyanins (purple) and a low concentration of chlorophyll in the fruit’s skin, a combination rarely found in commercial varieties.</li>
  <li>The complete absence of bitterness is achieved by selecting for plants with minimal synthesis of solasodine glycosides, the compounds responsible for the harsh flavour in under-ripe or certain types of eggplant.</li>
  <li>Its compact, high-yielding habit is governed by a bushy growth gene and a high fruit-set ratio, ensuring the plant’s energy is directed into producing its charming, clustered fruits rather than vegetative growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Micro Eggplant ‘Metro-Sakura’</strong> is a <strong>delicate, sweet, and stunningly ornamental</strong> variety, a masterpiece of miniaturization that offers a continuous harvest of beautiful, gourmet fruits from the most compact of spaces.</p>
