<h6 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h6>

<p><strong>1. Flavour and Form</strong>
‘FireDot’ delivers a sharp, direct heat with a Scoville rating of 50,000-70,000, followed by a slight, smoky fruitiness. The chilies are slender, about 3-4 cm long, and grow upright in dense clusters like tiny flares against the plant’s dark green, compact foliage. The plant forms a perfectly rounded, bushy mound no taller than 25 cm, making it as decorative as it is functional.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Ornamental Heat Bomb</strong>
This chili’s value is in its constant visual drama and potent, versatile heat.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Instant Culinary Spark:</strong> A single fresh pepper, finely minced, can infuse an entire pot of curry, soup, or stir-fry with a vibrant, clean heat.</li>
  <li><strong>Infused Oils &amp; Vinegars:</strong> The small, thin-walled fruits are perfect for steeping in olive oil or vinegar to create beautifully colored, powerfully spicy infusions.</li>
  <li><strong>Dried Spice Cache:</strong> The chilies air-dry easily and completely on the plant or can be harvested and dried for homemade crushed chili flakes that retain their intense heat and color.</li>
  <li><strong>Living Décor:</strong> Its colorful, prolonged fruiting display makes it a stunning centerpiece for a sunny balcony table or windowsill.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Harvest and Yield</strong>
‘FireDot’ is a continuous and astonishingly prolific producer from early summer until the first frost. Fruits can be harvested at any color stage for different visual and mild heat variations, but reach their maximum potency when fully red. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a <strong>seemingly endless supply, yielding hundreds of potent chilies over the season, with the first harvest ready about 80 days from transplant.</strong></p>
