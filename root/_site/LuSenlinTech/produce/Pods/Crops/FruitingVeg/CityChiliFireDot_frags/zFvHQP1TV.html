<h6 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h6>

<p>The brilliance of ‘FireDot’ lies in its optimized capsaicinoid production and perfect architectural form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The plant’s extreme compactness and high fruit load are stabilized by a strong, woody micro-stem structure and a modified phytochrome response, allowing it to flower and fruit prolifically even in the dappled light of a dense urban environment.</li>
  <li>The consistent, high heat level is controlled by a specific expression of the Pun1 gene, which regulates the production of capsaicinoids in the placenta of the fruit. ‘FireDot’ has been bred for a stable, “always-on” expression, ensuring reliable pungency in every single pepper, regardless of environmental fluctuations.</li>
  <li>The striking color progression is due to a synchronized and rapid breakdown of chlorophyll and anthocyanins (violet) followed by a swift accumulation of carotenoids (orange to red), creating a plant that always displays a vibrant spectrum of colors.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>City Chili ‘FireDot’</strong> is a <strong>decorative, dense, and deceptively hot</strong> pepper, a masterclass in concentrating both visual appeal and culinary firepower into a beautiful, balcony-sized package.</p>
