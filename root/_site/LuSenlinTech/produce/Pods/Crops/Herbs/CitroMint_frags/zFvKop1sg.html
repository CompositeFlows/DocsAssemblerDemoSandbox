<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>Citro-Mint delivers a dominant, zesty lemon flavour, clean and true, followed by a subtle, sweet spearmint finish that prevents any sharpness. The leaves are small, rounded, and slightly fuzzy, growing on a dense, mounding plant that rarely exceeds 20 cm in height, making it as decorative as it is useful.</p>

<h6 id="2-a-zest-for-refreshment">2. A Zest for Refreshment</h6>
<p>This mint is the ultimate herb for brightening drinks, desserts, and light dishes without overpowering them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Teas &amp; Infusions:</strong> The premier choice for a refreshing, caffeine-free lemon-mint tea. A single sprig elevates a glass of iced water or lemonade into a spa-like experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Desserts &amp; Fruit Salads:</strong> Finely chopped and sprinkled over fruit salads, sorbets, panna cotta, or fresh berries, where its citrus notes harmonize perfectly.</li>
  <li><strong>Seafood &amp; Salads:</strong> A brilliant garnish for grilled white fish, shrimp, and summer salads (like tabbouleh), adding a fragrant, citrusy lift that is more nuanced than lemon juice alone.</li>
  <li><strong>Cocktails:</strong> A essential muddled ingredient for Mojitos and other summer cocktails, providing a complex citrus backbone.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant forms a tight, bushy clump ideal for small spaces. Harvest by pinching off the top sets of leaves. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous yield of 15–25g of intensely fragrant leaves per week.</strong></p>
