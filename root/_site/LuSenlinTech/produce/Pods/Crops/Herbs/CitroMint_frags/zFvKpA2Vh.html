<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is a natural hybrid that has been perfected for the palate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its signature lemon aroma comes from a high concentration of the terpene citronellal, the same compound found in lemon balm and lemongrass, which is unusually dominant over the menthol and carvone typically found in mints.</li>
  <li>The “dwarf” characteristic is not a deficiency; it’s a result of selective breeding for shorter internodes (the spaces between leaves), which concentrates the aromatic oils and makes the plant incredibly productive for its size.</li>
  <li>Unlike its more vigorous mint cousins, Citro-Mint is a well-behaved clump-former with less aggressive runners, making it a polite and perfect citizen for a mixed herb planter or compact balcony garden.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Citro-Mint</strong> is a <strong>sunshine-infused refresher</strong>, a compact powerhouse that condenses the joyful essence of a summer garden into a single, prolific plant, ready to brighten any dish or drink at a moment’s notice.</p>
