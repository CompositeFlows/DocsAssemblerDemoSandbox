<p>‘Plum-Sage’ delivers a sophisticated sage profile: the classic earthy, slightly peppery, and camphorous base is complemented by subtle notes of plum and lemon, creating a more rounded and versatile flavour. Its leaves are small, velvety, and a deep, dusky plum-purple, forming a neat, well-branched mound.</p>
