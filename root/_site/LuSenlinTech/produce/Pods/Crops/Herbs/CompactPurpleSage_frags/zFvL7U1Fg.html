<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is a fusion of aesthetic appeal and culinary chemistry:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The stunning purple colour is due to anthocyanins, the same powerful antioxidant pigments found in blueberries and blackberries. In the plant, these pigments act as a natural sunscreen, protecting the leaves from intense light stress.</li>
  <li>Its unique, less-bitter flavour profile is linked to a different balance of thujone and camphor - the compounds responsible for sage’s characteristic sharpness - alongside higher levels of fruity esters, a trait selected for during its development.</li>
  <li>Historically, sage (<em>Salvia</em>, from the Latin <em>salvare</em>, “to save”) has been revered for its medicinal properties, particularly for memory and digestion. While ‘Plum-Sage’ is bred for cuisine, it retains the aromatic compounds that have linked this herb to wellness for centuries.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Compact Purple Sage ‘Plum-Sage’</strong> is a <strong>scented jewel of the herb garden</strong>, a dual-purpose plant that provides a continuous harvest of uniquely flavoured, gorgeously coloured leaves to add a touch of visual drama and sophisticated flavour to your cooking.</p>
