<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Narrow-Leaf Nano’ offers the true tarragon signature: a sophisticated, sweet licorice-anise flavour with a distinct, pleasant peppery-astringent finish that lingers on the palate. Its leaves are long, narrow, glossy, and a vibrant dark green, growing on a compact, upright, and less woody plant than standard French tarragon.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-soul-of-french-sophistication">2. The Soul of French Sophistication</h6>
<p>This herb is a cornerstone of French gastronomy and must be used with a delicate hand to preserve its nuanced flavour.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fines Herbes &amp; Béarnaise:</strong> The essential, non-negotiable component of the <em>fines herbes</em> blend and the defining flavour in Béarnaise sauce, where its aniseed character complements the richness of egg yolk and butter.</li>
  <li><strong>Chicken &amp; Seafood:</strong> A classic pairing with chicken (<em>Poulet à l’Estragon</em>), fish (especially salmon), and in creamy sauces for shellfish, where its sweetness enhances without overpowering.</li>
  <li><strong>Vinegars &amp; Dressings:</strong> The premier herb for infusing white wine vinegar, creating a foundational ingredient for sophisticated vinaigrettes and marinades.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a sterile, clump-forming perennial that must be propagated from cuttings or divisions, which is how this cultivar is supplied as a pre-vegetated plug. Harvest by snipping the tips of the stems. It provides a <strong>modest but potent yield of 5–15g of precious leaves per week. Its flavour is so intense that a few leaves are all that’s needed.</strong></p>
