<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is a piece of living culinary history, genetically stabilized for modern gardens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>True French tarragon is sterile and does not produce viable seeds; all plants are clones descended from an original specimen. ‘Narrow-Leaf Nano’ is a selection from these clones, chosen for its compact internodal spacing and upright, tidy growth.</li>
  <li>The signature sweet-anise flavour comes from estragole (methyl chavicol), a phenylpropene that also gives basil its sweet notes. The peppery, bitter finish is attributed to other compounds like isoestragole, creating a complexity that the bland, bitter Russian tarragon (<em>Artemisia dracunculus var. inodora</em>) completely lacks.</li>
  <li>Its species name, <em>dracunculus</em>, means “little dragon” in Latin, a name it earned both for its coiled, serpent-like root system and its historical use in treating dragon (snake) bites, a testament to its long history in the herbalist’s arsenal.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>French Tarragon ‘Narrow-Leaf Nano’</strong> is a <strong>clonal fragment of French culinary DNA</strong>, a precious and potent herb that delivers the uncompromising, authentic flavour required by classic cuisine, now tamed into a compact form for the discerning urban gardener.</p>
