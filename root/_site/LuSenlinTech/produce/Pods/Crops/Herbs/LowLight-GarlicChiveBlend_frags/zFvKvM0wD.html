<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This blend is a masterclass in plant adaptation and culinary synergy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “low-light” trait was selected from naturally shade-tolerant phenotypes. These plants have broader, thinner leaves (especially the garlic chive) with more chlorophyll to maximize photosynthesis in filtered light, unlike their sun-loving relatives that have developed protections against intense UV radiation.</li>
  <li>Garlic chives contain allicin, the same sulfur compound found in garlic that provides its characteristic pungency, while common chives are higher in sulfur compounds specific to onions. This blend literally gives you the best of both allium worlds.</li>
  <li>Unlike bulb onions or garlic, these chives focus their energy on leaf production rather than storing energy in a bulb, making them ideal for a continuous harvest system and perfectly suited for the constrained root zone of a modular balcony farm.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, the <strong>Low-Light Chive / Garlic-Chive Blend</strong> is a <strong>resilient, dual-purpose allium source</strong>, a clever combination that guarantees a steady supply of fresh, savoury flavour to enhance virtually any dish, even when your balcony is not drenched in full sun.</p>
