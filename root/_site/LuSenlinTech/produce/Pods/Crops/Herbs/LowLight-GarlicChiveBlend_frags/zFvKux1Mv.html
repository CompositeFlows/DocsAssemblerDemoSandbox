<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>This blend offers a dynamic range of allium flavours from a single source. The <strong>Common Chives</strong> provide fine, hollow leaves with a gentle, onion-like sharpness. The <strong>Garlic Chives</strong> contribute flat, solid blades with a distinctly stronger, more savory garlic aroma and flavor. Together, they create a complex, layered taste that is more interesting than either alone.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-all-purpose-allium-boost">2. The All-Purpose Allium Boost</h6>
<p>This blend is the ultimate “finishing” herb, designed to be sprinkled over dishes just before serving to retain its delicate flavour and vibrant colour.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eggs &amp; Dairy:</strong> A classic pairing. Stirred into soft-scrambled eggs, omelettes, or folded into cream cheese, sour cream, and butter.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads &amp; Soups:</strong> Provides a fresh, sharp counterpoint to green salads, potato salads, and as a garnish for creamy soups like vichyssoise.</li>
  <li><strong>Asian Stir-fries &amp; Dumplings:</strong> The garlic chive component is essential for dishes like <em>Jiaozi</em> (dumplings) and stir-fries, where its robust flavour stands up to high heat better than common chives.</li>
  <li><strong>Universal Garnish:</strong> A handful snipped over grilled meats, roasted vegetables, or pasta adds an instant lift of fresh, savoury complexity.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>Both varieties in the blend are “cut-and-come-again” perennials. Harvest by snipping leaves about 2 cm from the base, which encourages new growth from the center. Supplied as a combined RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous, mixed yield of 15–30g of fresh chives per week, even in lower light conditions.</strong></p>
