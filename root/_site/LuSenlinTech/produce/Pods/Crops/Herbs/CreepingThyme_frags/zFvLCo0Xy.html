<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Tiny-Thymus’ delivers a surprisingly powerful and complex thyme flavour: intensely earthy and peppery with distinct notes of mint, lemon, and a warm, floral aroma. The leaves are minuscule, needle-like, and grow on delicate, trailing stems that form a tight, fragrant mat rarely exceeding 3 cm in height.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-essence-of-slow-cooking">2. The Essence of Slow Cooking</h6>
<p>This thyme’s potent flavour is released slowly, making it ideal for dishes that simmer or roast.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bouquet Garni &amp; Stews:</strong> An essential component of a classic <em>bouquet garni</em> for stocks, stews, and braises. Its slow-release oils infuse dishes with a deep, herbal foundation that withstands long cooking times.</li>
  <li><strong>Roasted Classics:</strong> Sprigs tucked under the skin of roast chicken or scattered amongst roasting root vegetables impart an incomparable, savoury fragrance.</li>
  <li><strong>Honey &amp; Infusions:</strong> Can be steeped in honey, vinegar, or oil to create beautifully flavoured bases for dressings and marinades. The tiny leaves can also be stripped and used fresh in compound butters or as a garnish.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant forms a perennial, evergreen mat. Harvest by snipping small sprigs from the surface, which encourages denser growth. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous, modest yield of 5–15g of intensely concentrated fresh sprigs per week. A little goes an exceptionally long way.</strong></p>
