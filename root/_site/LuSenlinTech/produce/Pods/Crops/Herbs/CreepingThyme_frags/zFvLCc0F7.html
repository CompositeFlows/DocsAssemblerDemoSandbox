<p>This is a miniature, mat-forming cultivar of wild thyme, a living carpet of intense flavour and fragrance. ‘Tiny-Thymus’ packs the robust, earthy, and slightly floral essence of its larger relatives into a dense groundcover of tiny, evergreen leaves, making it as valuable as an ornamental edging as it is a culinary powerhouse.</p>
