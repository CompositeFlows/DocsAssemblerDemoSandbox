<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>This duo delivers the signature Holy Basil (<em>Tulsi</em>) flavour: a warm, spicy, and peppery profile with pronounced notes of clove and a subtle, lingering minty freshness. The purple leaves often carry a slightly more robust, earthy undertone. The plant forms an beautiful, ornamental bush with vibrant green and deep violet leaves.</p>

<h6 id="2-sacred-savor--modern-mixology">2. Sacred Savor &amp; Modern Mixology</h6>
<p>While sacred in tradition, its uses are vibrantly modern.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Herbal Teas &amp; Infusions:</strong> The primary use. A few fresh leaves make a profoundly aromatic, caffeine-free tea, known in Ayurveda as “The Incomparable One” for its balancing properties.</li>
  <li><strong>Savory Stir-fries &amp; Curries:</strong> A key ingredient in Thai dishes like <em>Pad Krapow</em>, though its flavour is distinct from sweet basil. It adds a spicy, complex depth that stands up to intense heat and garlic.</li>
  <li><strong>Cocktails &amp; Desserts:</strong> Muddling a leaf of each colour creates an incredible aromatic base for gin or rum cocktails. It can be steeped in syrups or cream for unique, spiced desserts.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a vigorous, branching perennial. Harvest the top sets of leaves regularly to maintain shape and encourage new growth, which will include both colour expressions. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous yield of 10–20g of mixed aromatic leaves per week.</strong></p>
