<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This duo is a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern genetics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Ayurvedic medicine, Holy Basil is classified as an adaptogen, believed to help the body resist physical, environmental, and emotional stressors. Modern science is investigating its bioactive compounds, like eugenol and rosmarinic acid, for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential.</li>
  <li>The purple colour is not just cosmetic; it comes from anthocyanins, powerful antioxidant pigments that the plant produces in response to light stress. This is a natural sunscreen, and in your body, it acts as a potent free-radical scavenger.</li>
  <li>This is a “sport mutation” cultivar, where a natural genetic variation causing the purple colour was discovered and selectively stabilized, allowing both the original green and the new purple to be grown from the same genetic source.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, the <strong>Purple Holy Basil Duo</strong> is a <strong>living adaptogenic tapestry</strong>, a plant that feeds both the body and soul, offering a daily harvest of sacred aroma, vibrant colour, and timeless wellness from a single, resilient plant.</p>
