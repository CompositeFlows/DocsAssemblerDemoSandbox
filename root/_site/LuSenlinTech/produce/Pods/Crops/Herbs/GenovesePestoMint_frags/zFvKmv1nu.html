<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>Genovese Pesto Mint™ offers a profoundly different mint experience. The initial cooling menthol “blast” is replaced by a smooth, sweet, and herbaceous flavour with distinct notes of basil, citrus, and warm spice. Its leaves are larger and more tender than traditional mint, with a vibrant green colour and a potent, yet gentle, aroma.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-savoury-mint-revolution">2. The Savoury Mint Revolution</h6>
<p>This mint is a versatile herb that seamlessly integrates into dishes where traditional mint would be overpowering.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Ultimate Pesto:</strong> It creates a stunningly complex and refreshing pesto, either on its own or blended with basil. It pairs exceptionally well with peas, feta, and lamb, creating a more nuanced and sophisticated flavour profile.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads &amp; Garnishes:</strong> A game-changer in salads, grain bowls, and as a garnish for soups and roasted vegetables, providing a fresh, herbal lift without the dominant cooling sensation.</li>
  <li><strong>Modern Cocktails &amp; Sauces:</strong> Allows for the use of mint in delicate cocktails without overwhelming other ingredients. It also forms the base for innovative sauces for fish, poultry, and roasted carrots.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a vigorous but well-behaved perennial. Regular harvesting of the top leaves encourages bushy, compact growth. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous yield of 20–30g of large, aromatic leaves per week.</strong></p>
