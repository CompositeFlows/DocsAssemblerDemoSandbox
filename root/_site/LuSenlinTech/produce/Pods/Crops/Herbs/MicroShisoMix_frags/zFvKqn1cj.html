<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>This mix offers a dramatic flavour punch from tiny leaves. The <strong>Green Shiso</strong> is bright, minty-citrus with hints of cinnamon and anise. The <strong>Red Shiso</strong> is more robust, with deeper cinnamon and bitter notes, and a stunning anthocyanin-rich burgundy colour that acts as a natural dye. Both are harvested as delicate, coin-sized micro-leaves.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-ultimate-umami-garnish">2. The Ultimate Umami Garnish</h6>
<p>These micro-leaves are designed for maximum impact in minimalist applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sushi &amp; Sashimi:</strong> The classic use. A single green shiso leaf under a piece of sashimi or in a hand roll cleanses the palate and complements the fish perfectly. Red shiso is traditionally used to colour and flavour umeboshi (pickled plums).</li>
  <li><strong>Salads &amp; Garnishes:</strong> A handful scattered over a salad, ceviche, or cold noodle dishes adds an unforgettable, complex aroma and a burst of colour.</li>
  <li><strong>Cocktails &amp; Infusions:</strong> Used as an aromatic garnish for cocktails or infused into vinegar, soy sauce, or salt to impart their unique flavour profile.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>Grown as a cut-and-come-again micro-green, the mix is harvested with scissors just above the soil line when the first true leaves appear. Supplied as a dedicated RFID seed pad, it provides <strong>multiple dense harvests of 20–30g of mixed micro-shiso from a single bay over a 2-3 week period.</strong></p>
