<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This mix captures the essence of a cornerstone of Japanese cuisine in its most potent form:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distinctive aroma of shiso comes from perillaldehyde, a compound unique to this genus, which provides the complex cinnamon-anise flavour that is irreplaceable in Japanese cooking.</li>
  <li>Red shiso’s colour comes from a pigment called shisonin, which not only provides its brilliant hue but also has documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making the herb as healthy as it is beautiful.</li>
  <li>By harvesting at the micro-leaf stage, the plant’s secondary metabolites - the compounds responsible for its unique flavour and colour - are at their peak concentration, delivering a more intense experience than mature leaves.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, the <strong>Micro-Shiso Mix</strong> is a <strong>concentrated essence of Japan</strong>, a powerful duo of aromatic micro-greens that delivers a lifetime of flavour in a single, prolific cut, bringing the authentic, complex taste of a Tokyo sushi bar directly to your balcony.</p>
