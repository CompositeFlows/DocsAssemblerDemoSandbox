<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>It offers the classic, robust basil profile: intensely sweet with notes of anise, clove, and pepper, but with a brighter, more concentrated top note. Its leaves are small, deeply green, and packed with aromatic oils, growing on a dense, bushy plant that rarely exceeds 25 cm in height.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-heart-of-italian-cuisine">2. The Heart of Italian Cuisine</h6>
<p>This basil is the irreplaceable soul of countless dishes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Perfect Pesto:</strong> Its high oil concentration and balanced sweetness create the most authentic and vibrant pesto Genovese, requiring less basil by volume to achieve the same profound flavour.</li>
  <li><strong>Caprese &amp; Salads:</strong> The ideal size for whole leaves in a Caprese salad, on bruschetta, or as a fragrant garnish for pasta and pizza, providing a burst of fresh aroma.</li>
  <li><strong>Infusions &amp; Desserts:</strong> Steeped in cream for ice cream, muddled into cocktails, or infused into simple syrups, its sweet character shines in both sweet and savoury applications.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a “cut-and-come-again” variety. Regular harvesting of the top leaves, just above a node, encourages a bushier, more productive form. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous yield of 15–25g of pristine leaves per week from a single bay.</strong></p>
