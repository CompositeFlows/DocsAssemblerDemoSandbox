<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar represents the pinnacle of culinary bio-engineering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “4.1” designation signifies its lineage; it is the result of four generations of phenotypic selection for compact growth and oil density, with a final, stable genetic tweak (the “.1”) to virtually eliminate premature flowering (bolting), ensuring a long harvest window.</li>
  <li>The signature basil aroma comes from a high concentration of linalool and estragole, volatile compounds that are most potent just before the plant flowers. By delaying bolting, ‘4.1’ maintains peak flavour for weeks longer than standard varieties.</li>
  <li>Unlike many dwarf plants, it has not sacrificed flavour for size. Its compact stature is due to shorter internodal spacing, meaning the leaves - and their oil glands - are actually more densely packed than in a larger plant.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Mini-Sweet Basil 4.1</strong> is a <strong>genetically stabilized flavour bomb</strong>, a living testament to the idea that the most authentic tastes can be perfected for modern life, delivering the soul of Italy from a single, prolific plant on your balcony.</p>
