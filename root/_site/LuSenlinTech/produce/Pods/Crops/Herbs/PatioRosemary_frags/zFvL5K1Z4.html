<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is a masterpiece of form and function, rooted in Mediterranean resilience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name ‘AromiStax’ is a portmanteau of “aroma” and “stacks,” referring to the vertical stacking of its fragrant leaf whorls. Its columnar form is a result of a rare natural mutation that suppresses lateral branching, a trait that has been carefully stabilized.</li>
  <li>Rosemary contains rosmarinic acid and carnostic acid, powerful antioxidants that not only give the herb its distinctive flavour but also act as natural preservatives, slowing the oxidation of fats in the meats it traditionally seasons.</li>
  <li>Its tough, needle-like leaves are an adaptation to the hot, dry, and windy Mediterranean climate. The small surface area and waxy coating (cuticle) minimize water loss, making it exceptionally drought-tolerant and perfectly suited for the sometimes-harsh microclimate of a sunny balcony.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Patio Rosemary ‘AromiStax’</strong> is a <strong>vertical vault of flavour</strong>, a structural evergreen that provides a relentless supply of one of the culinary world’s most robust and defining herbs, all from a space-saving form that fits perfectly into the urban landscape.</p>
