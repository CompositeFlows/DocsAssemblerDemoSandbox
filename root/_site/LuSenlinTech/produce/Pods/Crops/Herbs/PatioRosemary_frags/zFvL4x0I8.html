<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘AromiStax’ offers the quintessential, powerful rosemary profile: a bold, piney, and camphorous flavour with sharp, peppery notes and a clean, refreshing finish. Its needles are short, stiff, and densely packed around sturdy, upright stems, forming a narrow, columnar bush that resembles a miniature, aromatic conifer.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-robust-roasting-herb">2. The Robust Roasting Herb</h6>
<p>This rosemary is a foundational flavour for hearty dishes that can stand up to its assertive character.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Roasted Meats &amp; Vegetables:</strong> The quintessential partner for lamb, pork, and chicken, as well as robust roasted vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and squash. Its sturdy sprigs can be used as aromatic skewers.</li>
  <li><strong>Breads &amp; Focaccia:</strong> Finely chopped needles kneaded into bread dough or sprinkled over focaccia create an unforgettable, savoury fragrance.</li>
  <li><strong>Infused Oils &amp; Marinades:</strong> Steeped in olive oil or used in marinades to impart its powerful, woody essence. A single sprig can transform a bottle of oil or a jar of olives.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a slow-growing, woody perennial with a strongly vertical habit. Harvest by snipping the tips of the stems or removing individual branches from the bottom to maintain its shape. Supplied as a pre-vegetated plug for a head start, it provides a <strong>steady, year-round yield of 10–20g of potent needles per week from its compact form.</strong></p>
