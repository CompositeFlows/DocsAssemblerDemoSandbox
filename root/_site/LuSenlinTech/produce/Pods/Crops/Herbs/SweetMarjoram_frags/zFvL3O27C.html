<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar embodies the subtle chemistry that distinguishes fine herbs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While botanically a close relative of oregano (<em>Origanum majorana</em> vs. <em>Origanum vulgare</em>), its flavour profile is dominated by sabinene and terpinene, compounds that give it its characteristic sweet, pine-citrus aroma, rather than the pungent, medicinal carvacrol that defines Greek oregano.</li>
  <li>In ancient Greece and Rome, marjoram was a symbol of happiness and was used to crown newlyweds. Its gentle, uplifting scent was believed to ease grief and promote peace, a folklore that aligns with its calming, non-aggressive aromatic profile.</li>
  <li>The ‘Marj-Mini’ cultivar has been selected for shorter internodal spacing, meaning the leaves - and their precious oil glands - are packed more tightly together on the stem than in standard varieties, resulting in a higher yield of flavour from a smaller plant.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Sweet Marjoram ‘Marj-Mini’</strong> is a <strong>prolific pocket of fragrance</strong>, a gentle yet generous herb that proves the most memorable flavours are often the softest spoken, offering a continuous harvest of sweet, floral complexity for your most refined dishes.</p>
