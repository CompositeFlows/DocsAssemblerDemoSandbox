<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Marj-Mini’ possesses a uniquely sweet, warm, and slightly spicy flavour with pronounced floral notes of camphor and balsam, and a distinct absence of oregano’s characteristic bitterness. Its leaves are small, soft, oval, and a vibrant grey-green, growing on a dense, bushy plant that is exceptionally productive for its size.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-fragrant-finisher">2. The Fragrant Finisher</h6>
<p>This herb is best used at the end of cooking or raw to preserve its delicate, volatile oils.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Secret to Sausages:</strong> A classic, essential herb in many European sausage recipes, where its sweetness complements the rich, fatty meat without overpowering it.</li>
  <li><strong>Vegetables &amp; Cream Sauces:</strong> A transformative addition to sautéed mushrooms, roasted root vegetables, creamy pasta sauces, and vinaigrettes, adding a layer of sophisticated fragrance.</li>
  <li><strong>Herbal Butters &amp; Oils:</strong> Perfect for blending into compound butters for fish or steaks, or for steeping in olive oil to create a beautifully aromatic finishing oil for bread and salads.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant forms a tender perennial, bushy mound. Regular harvesting of the tip shoots encourages a denser, more productive form. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>surprisingly generous and continuous yield of 15–30g of tender, fragrant leaves per week.</strong></p>
