<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Frond-Flash’ offers the classic, clean dill profile: a bright, grassy flavour with distinct notes of anise, lemon, and a subtle celery-like freshness. Its foliage is finely dissected, feathery, and a vibrant light green, growing on a sturdy, self-supporting plant that remains productive for weeks longer than common dill.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-bright-fresh-finisher">2. The Bright, Fresh Finisher</h6>
<p>This dill is the quintessential herb for adding a fresh, lively note to a wide array of dishes, particularly those from Northern and Eastern European cuisines.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Seafood Partner:</strong> The indispensable garnish for gravlax (cured salmon) and a key flavour in creamy sauces for poached fish, shrimp, and scallops.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads &amp; Dips:</strong> A vital component in potato salads, cucumber salads, tzatziki, and sour cream-based dips, where its bright flavour cuts through richness.</li>
  <li><strong>Pickling &amp; Preserving:</strong> While bred for leaf production, if allowed to eventually flower, its umbels are perfect for flavourful pickling of cucumbers, beans, and other vegetables.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a fast-growing annual with a strong, central focus on foliage. Harvest the outer, feathery fronds regularly, allowing the central growing point to continue producing new leaves. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>rapid and continuous yield of 20–40g of delicate fronds per week for an extended season before it finally decides to bolt.</strong></p>
