<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is a triumph of selective breeding over a plant’s primal instincts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “bolt-resistant” nature of ‘Frond-Flash’ is due to selective breeding for a longer juvenile phase. We’ve chosen plants with a genetic predisposition to delay the production of gibberellin, the plant hormone that triggers the switch from leaf production to flowering and stem elongation.</li>
  <li>The signature dill aroma comes from a compound called carvone (specifically the D-carvone isomer), which is also found in caraway seeds. This is different from the compound that gives tarragon (estragole) or anise (anethole) their licorice-like flavours, giving dill its unique character.</li>
  <li>Unlike its tall, lanky relatives that can reach over a meter, ‘Frond-Flash’ exhibits a dwarf habit due to shorter internodes (the spaces between leaves). This creates a bushier, more stable plant that is ideal for windy balcony conditions and maximizes leaf production in a small volume.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Balcony Dill ‘Frond-Flash’</strong> is a <strong>bolt-defying fountain of freshness</strong>, a generous and resilient herb that solves the urban gardener’s greatest dill dilemma, ensuring a long-lasting, plentiful supply of its bright, feathery fronds for all your culinary creations.</p>
