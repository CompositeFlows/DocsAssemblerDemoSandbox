<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Metro-Pak Chee’ offers the distinct, robust coriander profile cherished in Thai cooking: a powerful citrus-cumin note with a bold, almost peppery intensity, and significantly less of the “soapy” aldehyde that some find disagreeable. The plant forms a dense, low rosette of large, serrated leaves, staying productive for months.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-soul-of-southeast-asian-cooking">2. The Soul of Southeast Asian Cooking</h6>
<p>This coriander is the indispensable fresh herb for a vast array of dishes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Curries &amp; Soups:</strong> A mandatory garnish for Thai green and red curries, <em>Tom Yum</em>, and <em>Tom Kha Gai</em> soups, where its bright, citrusy flavour cuts through the richness and spice.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads &amp; Relishes:</strong> The key ingredient in salads like <em>Yum Som O</em> (pomelo salad) and fresh relishes, providing a fresh, pungent counterpoint to sweet, sour, and spicy notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Herb Garnish:</strong> Used in vast quantities as a bed for grilled meats and as a final flourish on noodle dishes like <em>Pad Thai</em>, to be mixed in at the table.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a slow-bolting, multi-branching variety. Harvest the larger outer leaves regularly, allowing the central growing point to continue producing. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous yield of 25–40g of large, potent leaves per week for an extended season.</strong></p>
