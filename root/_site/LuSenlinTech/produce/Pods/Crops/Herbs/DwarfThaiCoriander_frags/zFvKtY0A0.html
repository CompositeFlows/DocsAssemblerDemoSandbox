<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar solves the most common frustration for coriander lovers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “soapy” taste some people detect is linked to a specific gene that makes them sensitive to certain aldehydes in the leaves. ‘Metro-Pak Chee’ has been selectively bred from Thai landraces that naturally possess a different balance of aromatic compounds (higher linalool, lower aldehydes), resulting in a more universally pleasing, citrus-forward profile.</li>
  <li>Its dwarf, bushy habit and slow-bolting nature are the result of selecting for specific genetic markers that delay the plant’s transition from leaf production to flowering, giving you a much longer window to enjoy the leaves.</li>
  <li>The name ‘Pak Chee’ is the Thai word for coriander, signalling its authentic culinary heritage and distinguishing it from the more mild-mannered coriander varieties typically found in Western supermarkets.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Dwarf Thai Coriander ‘Metro-Pak Chee’</strong> is a <strong>bolt-resistant flavour powerhouse</strong>, a generous and reliable herb that finally makes it possible to have a continuous, authentic supply of this essential Southeast Asian ingredient at your fingertips.</p>
