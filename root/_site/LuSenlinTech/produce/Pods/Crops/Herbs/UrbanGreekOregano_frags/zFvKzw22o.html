<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘OG-35’ offers the true, authentic Greek oregano profile: a bold, peppery kick with complex notes of camphor, mint, and a pleasant, balancing bitterness. Its flavour is significantly more robust and less sweet than common Italian oregano. The plant is a compact, woody-stemmed perennial with small, fuzzy, grey-green leaves that are dense with essential oils.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-heart-of-mediterranean-cooking">2. The Heart of Mediterranean Cooking</h6>
<p>This oregano is a foundational dried herb, but its fresh form is a revelation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Pizza &amp; Pasta Herb:</strong> The undisputed champion for tomato-based sauces, pizza, and lasagna. Its bold flavour doesn’t fade when baked, becoming more complex and aromatic.</li>
  <li><strong>Grilled Meats &amp; Roasts:</strong> The essential component in Greek marinades for lamb, chicken, and fish (especially the classic <em>Ladolemono</em>). Rubbed onto roasted vegetables or potatoes, it evokes the flavours of a sun-drenched taverna.</li>
  <li><strong>Legumes &amp; Stews:</strong> A key herb for seasoning lentil soups, bean stews, and braised dishes, where its earthy, peppery notes complement hearty ingredients.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant is a woody perennial that benefits from regular harvesting to prevent it from becoming leggy. Pinch or snip the stem tips just above a leaf node. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a <strong>continuous yield of 10–20g of intensely aromatic fresh leaves per week. For the most potent flavour, harvest just before the plant flowers and dry the leaves.</strong></p>
