<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This fern is a miniature marvel of natural engineering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Azolla forms a symbiosis with the cyanobacterium <em>Anabaena azollae</em>, which lives in cavities within its leaves. The bacterium converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a form of nitrogen the plant can use, a process known as nitrogen fixation.</li>
  <li>For centuries, it has been used in rice paddies in Southeast Asia as a natural fertilizer, famously referred to as “green manure.”</li>
  <li>The Azolla fern event is a paleontological hypothesis that suggests a massive bloom of Azolla in the Arctic Ocean 49 million years ago played a key role in transitioning the Earth from a “greenhouse” to an “icehouse” climate by drawing down atmospheric CO₂.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Azolla ‘Nitro-Fern Nano’</strong> is a <strong>symbiotic nutrient engine</strong>, a living link to ancient planetary processes that you can harness to create a more fertile and sustainable closed-loop garden.</p>
