<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>Azolla has a mild, neutral, slightly grassy flavour and a soft, delicate texture. Its tiny, overlapping leaves form a dense, vibrant green mat on the water’s surface, creating a beautiful and functional living carpet.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-ultimate-garden-partner">2. The Ultimate Garden Partner</h6>
<p>Its main role is as a sustainable nutrient source.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Living Fertilizer:</strong> Regularly harvest portions of the mat and add them directly to the growth media of other plants, such as those in the TuberTower or FruitForge, where it decomposes and releases a gentle, plant-available form of nitrogen.</li>
  <li><strong>Aquatic Filter:</strong> The dense mat helps purify water by absorbing excess nutrients, improving the environment for fish and shrimp in integrated systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Edible Use:</strong> While not a primary food source due to its small size, it can be blended into green smoothies for a nutrient boost.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The fern forms a continuous, self-renewing mat on the water’s surface. Harvesting is as simple as skimming a portion with a net. A single RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges mat provides a <strong>continuous yield of 30–50g of fresh biomass daily</strong>, perfect for feeding the rest of your balcony farm.</p>
