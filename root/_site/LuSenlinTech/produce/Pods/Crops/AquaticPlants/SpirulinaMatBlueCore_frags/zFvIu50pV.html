<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>Spirulina is a testament to ancient nutrition and modern science:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is believed to have been a food source for the Aztecs in Lake Texcoco (now Mexico City), who harvested and sun-dried it into cakes called “tecuitlatl.”</li>
  <li>It is one of the few food sources of the antioxidant phycocyanin, the pigment that gives it its brilliant blue colour, which has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.</li>
  <li>NASA and the European Space Agency have extensively researched Spirulina for its potential use in long-term space missions due to its incredible nutritional efficiency - it produces more protein per unit area than any other food source.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Spirulina Mat ‘BlueCore’</strong> is a <strong>primordial nutrient concentrate</strong>, offering a direct link to the ancient power of photosynthesis in its most potent and usable form.</p>
