<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>

<p>‘Hydro-Pepper’ is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and crisp, succulent stems. Its flavour is a clean, sharp, and intense pepperiness, without the slight minerality sometimes found in soil-grown cress. This makes it an exceptionally versatile and potent garnish or salad component.</p>

<h6 id="2-a-culinary-chameleon">2. A Culinary Chameleon</h6>

<p>This watercress is a foundational ingredient for adding a fresh, pungent spark to a wide array of dishes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic Pairings:</strong> The quintessential base for peppery salads, a vibrant garnish for cold soups (like vichyssoise or gazpacho), and the perfect sharp counterpoint in sandwiches and wraps.</li>
  <li><strong>Modern Applications:</strong> Its intense flavour stands up well to blending into potent green sauces and pestos, providing a peppery backbone without the need for garlic or chili.</li>
  <li><strong>Global Cuisine:</strong> A staple in European garnishes, it also fits seamlessly into Southeast Asian dishes like <em>Pho</em> and <em>Laksa</em>, where its clean pepperiness complements aromatic broths.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>

<p>The plant is designed for a ‘cut-and-come-again’ harvest. Snipping the stems just above a leaf node encourages bushy regrowth, providing a <strong>continuous yield of 20–30g of pristine, ready-to-eat greens per week</strong> from a single HydraPad™.</p>
