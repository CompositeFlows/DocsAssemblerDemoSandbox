<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar is made possible by contemporary research and selective breeding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike its semi-aquatic ancestor, ‘Hydro-Pepper’ is a true hydrophyte, possessing specialized air channels (aerenchyma) that allow it to be fully submerged without rot, absorbing all necessary nutrients directly from the water.</li>
  <li>The intense peppery flavour comes from high concentrations of gluconasturtiin, a glucosinolate that converts to the sharp phenethyl isothiocyanate when the leaves are damaged (chewed or cut) - a potent, natural defence mechanism that we experience as flavour.</li>
  <li>By growing it in a controlled aquatic system, we eliminate the risk of contamination from the parasite <em>Fasciola hepatica</em> (liver fluke), a concern sometimes associated with wild-harvested watercress from open streams.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Dwarf Watercress ‘Hydro-Pepper’</strong> is a <strong>bio-optimized aquatic green</strong> that delivers a consistently intense, clean, and safe peppery flavour, bringing the essence of a freshwater spring directly to your urban kitchen.</p>
