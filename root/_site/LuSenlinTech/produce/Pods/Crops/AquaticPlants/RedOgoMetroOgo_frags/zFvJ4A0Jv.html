<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>It offers a firm, snappy, almost cartilaginous crunch that is uniquely satisfying. Its flavour is a well-balanced blend of fresh ocean brine with a distinct, sweet finish. The branches are deep red, translucent, and form beautiful, intricate clumps that add visual drama to any dish.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-crunch-of-the-coast">2. The Crunch of the Coast</h6>
<p>This seaweed is a textural superstar, essential for specific culinary applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Poke Bowl Essential:</strong> A non-negotiable ingredient in authentic Hawaiian poke, providing a crucial crunchy contrast to the soft, marinated cubes of raw fish and creamy avocado.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Salads:</strong> Shines in seaweed salads, either on its own or mixed with other sea vegetables like sea lettuce. Its robust texture holds up well to bold, citrus-based dressings.</li>
  <li><strong>Sushi &amp; Seafood Garnish:</strong> Used as a bed for sashimi or a garnish for grilled fish, adding both a splash of colour and a burst of oceanic crunch.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The algae grows in dense, bushy clumps on the HydraPad™. Harvesting involves trimming the bushiest branches from the main clump, which encourages further branching. A single pad provides a <strong>continuous yield of 40–60g of crisp, ready-to-eat seaweed every 2-3 weeks.</strong></p>
