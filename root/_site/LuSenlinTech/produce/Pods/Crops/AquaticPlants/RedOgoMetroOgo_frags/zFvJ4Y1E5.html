<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>‘Metro-Ogo’ is a cultivar with deep cultural roots and unique biological traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a primary source for agar, a gelatinous substance used worldwide as a vegetarian alternative to gelatin. However, ‘Metro-Ogo’ is cultivated from a strain selected for low agar content, prioritizing its culinary crunch over its gelling properties.</li>
  <li>In Hawaii, wild <em>Gracilaria</em> is known as <em>ogo</em> and has been foraged from tidal pools for generations, forming a foundational element of the islands’ local food culture.</li>
  <li>Its brilliant red colour comes from phycoerythrin, a pigment that helps the algae absorb blue-green light in deeper water. This pigment is also a powerful antioxidant.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Red Ogo ‘Metro-Ogo’</strong> is a <strong>cultured crunch from the coral reef</strong>, a textural and cultural icon that delivers the authentic taste and satisfying snap of a Hawaiian shore directly to your urban kitchen.</p>
