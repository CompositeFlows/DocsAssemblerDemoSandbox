<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>The blend has a remarkably neutral, mildly grassy, and slightly sweet flavour, often compared to fresh green peas or alfalfa sprouts. Its tiny, leaf-like fronds (thalli) create a delicate, caviar-like texture that disappears into dishes, making it a true “stealth health” ingredient.</p>

<h6 id="2-a-versatile-protein-powerhouse">2. A Versatile Protein Powerhouse</h6>
<p>This blend is designed to be a foundational, everyday protein source.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Ultimate Smoothie Booster:</strong> A single scoop blended into a morning smoothie effortlessly adds 5-7 grams of complete protein without altering the flavour or texture.</li>
  <li><strong>Vegan Culinary Applications:</strong> Mix fresh into veggie burger patties, falafel, or savoury pancakes to bind ingredients and boost nutritional value. Dehydrated and ground into a fine, vibrant green “Lentein” flour, it can be added to pasta, bread, and baked goods.</li>
  <li><strong>Garnish &amp; Topping:</strong> Use fresh as a nutritious, elegant garnish for soups, salads, and grain bowls, adding a pop of colour and a subtle fresh flavour.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The blend grows as a floating mat that doubles its biomass every 24-48 hours. Harvesting is a simple process of skimming the surface. A standard RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges mat provides a <strong>continuous yield of 40–60g of fresh, protein-rich biomass daily</strong>, which can be used immediately, refrigerated for a week, or dehydrated for long-term storage.</p>
