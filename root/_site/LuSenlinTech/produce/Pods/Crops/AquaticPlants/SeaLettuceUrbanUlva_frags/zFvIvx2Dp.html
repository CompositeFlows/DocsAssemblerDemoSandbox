<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>Sea lettuce is a fascinating and resilient organism:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a type of green algae that can be found in coastal waters worldwide, a testament to its adaptability. The ‘Urban Ulva’ strain has been selected for its particularly mild flavour and rapid growth in controlled conditions.</li>
  <li>It is an “indicator species;” large blooms in the wild can signal nutrient pollution (eutrophication). In your controlled system, it instead acts as a nutrient scrubber, helping to maintain clean water.</li>
  <li>It is rich in dietary fibre, iron, and vitamin C, which can enhance the absorption of its plant-based iron.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Sea Lettuce ‘Urban Ulva’</strong> is the <strong>gateway sea vegetable</strong>, a mild-mannered and versatile algae that effortlessly brings the fresh, healthy taste of the sea to your everyday cooking.</p>
