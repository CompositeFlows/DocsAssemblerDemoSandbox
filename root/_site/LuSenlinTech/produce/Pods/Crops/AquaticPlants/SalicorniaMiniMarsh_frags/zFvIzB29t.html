<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>It is intensely crisp and juicy, with a bright, clean salinity that evokes the ocean breeze. Its flavour is a direct, refreshing saltiness, often with a subtle, earthy undertone. The stems are tender yet satisfyingly snappy, with no tough fibres.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-oceans-crunch">2. The Ocean’s Crunch</h6>
<p>This plant is celebrated for its unique texture and built-in seasoning.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Ultimate Garnish:</strong> A premier garnish for seafood - especially oysters, grilled fish, and scallops - where its salty crunch complements the delicate brininess of the ocean.</li>
  <li><strong>Salads &amp; Pickles:</strong> Adds a spectacular textural and flavourful element to fresh salads. It can be quickly pickled in vinegar to balance its saltiness, creating a sophisticated condiment.</li>
  <li><strong>Sautéed Side Dish:</strong> Briefly sautéed in a touch of butter or oil, it wilts slightly, becoming a luxurious, stand-alone side dish that requires no added salt.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant grows in upright, branching stems. Harvesting involves snipping the tender upper portions of the stems. A single HydraPad™ provides a <strong>continuous yield of 60–80g of pristine stems every 3-4 weeks</strong>, allowing for multiple harvests from the same plant.</p>
