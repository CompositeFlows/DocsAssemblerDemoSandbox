<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>‘Baby Kombu’ offers a robust, savoury-sweet flavour, packed with deep umami. It is softer and more tender than traditional kombu, but still possesses a satisfying, slightly firm texture that holds up beautifully in cooking. A white, crystalline dust of natural glutamates often coats its surface - the visual promise of its flavour power.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-foundation-of-flavour">2. The Foundation of Flavour</h6>
<p>This kelp is the secret weapon for building depth in a vast array of dishes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Ultimate Broth:</strong> A single 5cm piece is enough to create a rich, clear dashi broth, the fundamental base for miso soup, noodle dishes, and sauces. It is always gently simmered, never boiled, to extract its sweetness without bitterness.</li>
  <li><strong>Savory Stews &amp; Braises:</strong> Add a piece to bean stews, pot roasts, or braised vegetables. It tenderizes fibres and imparts a rich, savoury background note that enhances other ingredients.</li>
  <li><strong>Seasoning &amp; Condiments:</strong> After making broth, the rehydrated kelp can be finely sliced and marinated into a delicious tsukudani (a sweet-savoury simmered condiment) or dried and ground into a potent umami salt.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The kelp grows as a single, strap-like blade from a central holdfast on the HydraPad™. Mature blades are harvested by cutting at the base. A single pad provides a <strong>sustained yield of 2-3 blades, each 15-20cm long, ready for harvest every 4-5 weeks.</strong></p>
