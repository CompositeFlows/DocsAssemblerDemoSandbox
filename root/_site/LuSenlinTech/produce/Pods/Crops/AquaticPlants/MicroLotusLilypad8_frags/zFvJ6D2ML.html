<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>The young, rolled shoots (stems) are the primary edible, with a remarkably crisp, juicy texture similar to a water chestnut but more delicate, and a clean, mildly sweet, and nutty flavour. The mature leaves are not typically eaten but are stunningly decorative.</p>

<h6 id="2-a-dual-purpose-aquatic-treasure">2. A Dual-Purpose Aquatic Treasure</h6>
<p>This plant provides both aesthetic beauty and unique culinary ingredients.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Culinary Star - Stems:</strong> The young, unopened stems are a prized vegetable in Asian cuisines. They can be sliced and added to stir-fries for a refreshing crunch, pickled for a tangy condiment, or eaten raw in salads.</li>
  <li><strong>The Decorative Canvas - Pads:</strong> The perfectly round, blue-green pads are naturally water-repellent. They are used as stunning, natural serving platters for canapés, sushi, or desserts, imparting a subtle, fresh aroma.</li>
  <li><strong>Aromatic Wrap:</strong> Fresh lotus leaves are traditionally used to wrap and steam sticky rice and meats, to which they impart a unique, fragrant, tea-like aroma.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant produces a continuous sequence of stems and pads from a central rhizome embedded in the HydraPad™. Harvesting involves cutting young, firm stems (before the leaf unfurls) at the base. A single plant provides a <strong>continuous yield of 3-5 harvestable stems per week, alongside a beautiful display of emerging pads.</strong></p>
