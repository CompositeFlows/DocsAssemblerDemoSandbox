<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This tiny plant is a fascinating example of rapid adaptation and botanical efficiency:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Frogbit is a “neotenic” plant, meaning it retains its juvenile, floating form throughout its life and rarely flowers in cultivation, dedicating all its energy to vegetative reproduction.</li>
  <li>Its leaves are covered in a superhydrophobic (water-repelling) wax coating, causing water to bead up and roll off perfectly. This natural nanotechnology, known as the “lotus effect,” keeps the harvestable parts perfectly dry and clean.</li>
  <li>While its wild relatives can become invasive in some waterways, ‘Tiny Shield’ is a sterile, patented cultivar specifically bred for controlled environments, ensuring its prolific growth benefits your ecosystem without any ecological risk.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Frogbit ‘Tiny Shield’</strong> is a <strong>self-cleaning aquatic garnish</strong>, a prolific producer of elegant, crisp foliage that brings a touch of pristine pond-side freshness and a delightful crunch to your most refined dishes.</p>
