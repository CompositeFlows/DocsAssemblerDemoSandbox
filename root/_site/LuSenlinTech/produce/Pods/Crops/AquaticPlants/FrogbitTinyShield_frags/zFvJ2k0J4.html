<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>The leaves and petioles (stem stalks) offer an exceptionally clean, crisp, and mildly sweet flavour with subtle cucumber-like notes. The texture is its standout feature - a satisfying, airy crunch similar to iceberg lettuce, but more delicate. The entire plant, from its tiny roots to its perfect round leaves, is edible.</p>

<h6 id="2-a-delicate-garnish--crunchy-accent">2. A Delicate Garnish &amp; Crunchy Accent</h6>
<p>Its primary role is to add visual elegance and a light, fresh crunch.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Ultimate Floating Garnish:</strong> An exquisite, edible garnish for cold soups, particularly gazpacho and vichyssoise, where it floats artistically. It also adds a beautiful touch to seafood dishes, cocktails, and summer salads.</li>
  <li><strong>Salad &amp; Taco Topper:</strong> Provides a unique, crunchy texture in mixed green salads or as a fresh, unexpected topping for fish tacos and ceviche.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick-Pickled Delicacy:</strong> The stems and leaves can be lightly quick-pickled in rice vinegar, enhancing their crunch and adding a sweet-and-sour note that complements rich dishes like pork or duck.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant reproduces rapidly by sending out runners, forming a dense mat on the water’s surface. Harvesting is as simple as skimming the desired quantity of individual plants from the surface. A single RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges mat provides a <strong>continuous, abundant yield of 30–50g of pristine, ready-to-eat foliage daily.</strong></p>
