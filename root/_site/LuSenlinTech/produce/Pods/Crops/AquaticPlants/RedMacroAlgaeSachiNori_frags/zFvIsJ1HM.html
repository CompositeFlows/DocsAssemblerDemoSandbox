<h5 id="the-science--story-behind-it">The Science &amp; Story Behind It</h5>

<p>This cultivar connects you to a thousand-year-old culinary history:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nori cultivation dates back to 8th century Japan, but its life cycle was a mystery until the mid-20th century when British phycologist Kathleen Drew-Baker discovered it alternated between a leafy phase (the nori we eat) and a microscopic, shell-boring phase. Her research saved Japan’s nori industry, and a monument to her stands in Kumamoto, Japan.</li>
  <li>The unique umami flavour comes from a high concentration of free amino acids, like glutamate, and nucleotides, which are released when the seaweed is toasted or rehydrated.</li>
  <li>It is incredibly nutrient-dense, being one of the best plant-based sources of iodine, essential for thyroid function, and also rich in taurine, an amino acid important for cardiovascular health.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>Red Macro-Algae ‘Sachi-Nori’</strong> is a <strong>cultured piece of culinary history</strong>, delivering the pure, authentic taste of the sea and the profound umami that has defined a cuisine for centuries.</p>
