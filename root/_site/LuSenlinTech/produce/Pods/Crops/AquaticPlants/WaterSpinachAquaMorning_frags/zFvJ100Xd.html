<h5 id="culinary-profile--uses">Culinary Profile &amp; Uses</h5>

<h6 id="1-flavour-and-form">1. Flavour and Form</h6>
<p>It offers a mild, sweet, and subtly earthy flavour, often compared to a cross between spinach and watercress. Its magic lies in its texture: the hollow stems (petioles) remain incredibly crisp and succulent when cooked, while the leaves wilt into tenderness. This cultivar produces an abundance of tender stems with minimal fibre.</p>

<h6 id="2-the-stir-fry-sovereign">2. The Stir-Fry Sovereign</h6>
<p>This green is the star of the wok, but its uses are wonderfully diverse.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Classic Stir-Fry:</strong> The most famous preparation is <em>Pad Pak Bung Fai Daeng</em> (flash-fried water spinach with chili and garlic). Its hollow stems literally “drink” up the savoury sauce, creating an unforgettable texture and flavour in every bite.</li>
  <li><strong>Soups &amp; Curries:</strong> Adds a refreshing, crisp element to brothy soups like <em>Sinigang</em> and coconut-based curries, where it softens slightly but retains a pleasant bite.</li>
  <li><strong>Fresh &amp; Blanched:</strong> Young leaves and stems can be used fresh in salads or quickly blanched and dressed with sesame oil and soy for a simple, elegant side dish.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="3-the-harvest-and-yield">3. The Harvest and Yield</h6>
<p>The plant grows vigorously, producing long, vining stems. Harvesting is a ‘cut-and-come-again’ process; snipping the main stem -2 inches from the base encourages the growth of multiple new side shoots. A single HydraPad™ provides a <strong>continuous yield of 150–200g of prime stems and leaves per week.</strong></p>
