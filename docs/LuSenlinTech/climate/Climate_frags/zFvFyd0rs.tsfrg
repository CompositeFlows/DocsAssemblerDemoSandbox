## Climate

Your local climate profile is processed by the **HarvestSage™** AI to calculate the optimal specifications for your modules. This includes determining the ideal **PureLight™** panel thickness and pre-configuring the **PrecisionHeat™** system, ensuring perfect root-zone temperatures are maintained automatically. This protects your plants from extremes and optimizes energy use.
