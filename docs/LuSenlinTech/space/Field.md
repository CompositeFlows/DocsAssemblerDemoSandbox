## Field

A field installation represents the pinnacle of scalable, decentralized food production. This is not a standard kit, but a turnkey agricultural facility designed and built to your specifications.

Transforming an open field into a high-yield vertical farming operation is a significant engineering project. It involves civil works, high-capacity utility connections, large-scale climate control, and complex logistics.

**For projects of this scale, the process begins with a consultation.** Please contact our industrial projects team to discuss your vision, goals, and site specifics. Based on this, **Lǜ Sēnlín** will undertake a comprehensive feasibility study and create a detailed master plan, treating your project with the same rigor as a factory installation.

This end-to-end service includes:
*   **Full Site & Infrastructure Planning**
*   **Custom Engineering & Architectural Design**
*   **Turnkey Installation & Commissioning**
*   **Ongoing Operational Support**

**Contact our Industrial Projects Team** to initiate the scoping and bidding process for your large-scale installation.
