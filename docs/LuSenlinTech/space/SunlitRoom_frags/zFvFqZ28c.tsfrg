### Powering Your Sunlit Room Verical Garden

Your garden leverages natural light but relies on a stable grid connection to power its essential support systems.

The **NanoSunBeam™** LED array and climate controls are designed for efficiency, drawing minimal power to supplement sunlight and maintain the ideal environment. A standard household socket is perfectly adequate for this task.

This configuration ensures:
*   **Uninterrupted Operation:** Consistent power for supplemental lighting during cloudy periods and evenings, guaranteeing a steady daily light integral (DLI) for your plants.
*   **Climate Stability:** Reliable operation of the **PrecisionHeat™** and ventilation systems, protecting your garden from temperature fluctuations.
*   **Set-and-Forget Simplicity:** Once plugged in, the garden manages its energy needs automatically, requiring no battery swaps or complex power management.

This approach provides a hands-off, highly reliable solution that works seamlessly with your home's existing electrical infrastructure.
