### Powering Your Indoor Vertical Garden

Your windowless garden requires a completely self-contained energy solution, built around a robust, hot-swappable battery configuration.

The foundation is a bank of four **SolisCell™** power modules. This design provides enough energy to run the **NanoSunBeam™** LED array and all climate controls for up to two weeks, based on the specific power draw of your selected modules and the environmental needs of your crops.

This approach is defined by its flexibility:
*   **Hot-Swappable Operation:** You can seamlessly remove one module at a time for charging while the garden continues operating on the remaining three.
*   **Grid-Independent Resilience:** A permanent power socket is ideal for continuous charging, but not mandatory. The setup allows you to manage energy through a simple cycle of charging and swapping.
*   **Adaptive Performance:** The unit intelligently manages power consumption, ensuring stable performance whether on one battery or all four.

This provides a highly resilient, off-grid-capable power architecture tailored for a controlled indoor environment.
