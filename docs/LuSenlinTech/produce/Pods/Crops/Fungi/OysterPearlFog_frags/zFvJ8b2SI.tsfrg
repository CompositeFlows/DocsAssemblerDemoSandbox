###### The Science & Story Behind It

The reliability of ‘Pearl-Fog’ is rooted in its robust genetics and environmental tolerance.
- Its exceptional adaptability to lower and less stable humidity levels (as low as 65-70%) is due to selective breeding for strains with a thicker, more hydrophobic cap cuticle, which reduces water loss in the dry air typical of balcony environments.
- The fast colonization and pinning are a result of selecting for a highly aggressive rhizomorphic mycelial network that efficiently dominates the substrate and responds quickly to the temperature drop and fresh air exchange that trigger fruiting.
- The consistent, classic form and flavour are maintained by stabilizing the genetic expression of the enzymes responsible for the development of the signature oyster mushroom aroma compounds, ensuring a predictable culinary result with every harvest.

In short, **Oyster ‘Pearl-Fog’** is a **resilient, high-yielding, and flavour-classic** cultivar, a foundational mushroom strain that guarantees success and a bountiful harvest for the balcony mushroom grower.
