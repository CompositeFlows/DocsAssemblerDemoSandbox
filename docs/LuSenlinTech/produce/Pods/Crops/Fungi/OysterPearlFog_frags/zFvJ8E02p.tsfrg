###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Pearl-Fog’ offers the classic, versatile oyster mushroom profile: a mild, sweet, and nutty flavour with a hint of licorice or anise on the nose. The caps are smooth, tongue-shaped, and range from pale dove-gray to soft slate, growing in dense, overlapping clusters. The flesh is tender yet resilient, with a velvety texture that holds up well to cooking without becoming slimy.

**2. The Ultimate Culinary Workhorse**
This mushroom's mild but distinctive flavour and excellent texture make it incredibly adaptable in the kitchen.
- **Sautéed or Stir-fried:** The premier method - quickly cooked over high heat with garlic and butter or oil, where it develops a beautiful sear and its sweet, nutty notes are enhanced.
- **Soups and Stews:** Adds a rich, savory depth to broths and creamy soups, contributing umami without overpowering other ingredients.
- **"Pulled" Meat Substitute:** The fibrous texture of the larger caps makes them ideal for shredding and braising, creating a satisfying plant-based alternative for sandwiches and tacos.
- **Tempura and Frying:** Its delicate flesh and ability to hold a light batter make it excellent for frying, resulting in a crisp exterior and tender interior.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Pearl-Fog’ is a rapid and prolific fruiter. Harvest entire clusters by twisting gently at the base when the caps are still slightly curled under but have fully expanded; avoid waiting until the edges flatten completely. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a **substantial and reliable yield of 600–900g of fresh mushrooms over 2-3 heavy flushes, with the first harvest ready for picking just 10-14 days after initiating fruiting conditions.**
