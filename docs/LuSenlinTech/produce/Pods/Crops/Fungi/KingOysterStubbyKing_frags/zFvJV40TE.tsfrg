###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Stubby-King’ offers the classic, robust umami flavor of King Oysters: a savory, slightly almond-like taste with a rich, earthy depth. The stems are exceptionally thick (4-6 cm diameter) and short (5-8 cm tall), with a firm, solid, white interior. The caps are small, dark tan, and often remain tightly incurred, almost appearing as an afterthought to the massive stem. The texture is remarkably dense and meaty, capable of holding a sear and remaining juicy.

**2. The Ultimate Scallop and Steak Substitute**
This mushroom's formidable structure and rich flavor make it unparalleled for applications where a meaty texture is desired.
- **Scallop Medallions:** The premier use - sliced horizontally into thick rounds, scored, and seared to create vegan scallops with an astonishingly similar texture and mouthfeel.
- **Grilled "Steaks":** Sliced vertically into thick planks, marinated, and grilled or pan-seared, developing a crust while the interior remains tender and juicy.
- **Braised and Stewed:** Its dense flesh stands up magnificently to long, slow cooking, absorbing braising liquids while maintaining structural integrity.
- **Shaved for Carpaccio:** Using a mandoline, the stems can be shaved paper-thin for a delicate, flavorful mushroom carpaccio.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Stubby-King’ is a moderate-speed fruiter that produces a smaller number of heavy, substantial individual mushrooms. Harvest when the stems have reached their full girth but before the caps begin to significantly expand and flatten. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a **yield of 3-5 substantial, thick-stemmed mushrooms per block, with a total weight of 500–800g over 1-2 flushes, ready for harvest 14-20 days after initiating fruiting conditions.**
