‘Stubby-King’ is a dwarf, thick-stemmed strain of King Oyster (*Pleurotus eryngii*) engineered for maximum girth and minimal height, making it the ultimate King variety for container production. This cultivar directs its energy into forming extraordinarily thick, dense stems with small, underdeveloped caps, creating a mushroom that is almost entirely composed of the prized, meaty "scallop" portion. ‘Stubby-King’ delivers the same rich, umami-forward flavor and solid, steak-like texture of standard Kings, but in a compact, space-efficient form that maximizes culinary yield per square centimeter.
