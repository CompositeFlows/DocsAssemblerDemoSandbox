###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Candy-Cap’ offers a powerful, complex flavor profile: an initial rich, smoky ham-like savoriness followed by subtle shrimp-like sweetness and a firm, meaty texture that stands up to high-heat cooking. The caps are firm, thick-fleshed, and maintain their vibrant pink-orange color through harvest, fading only slightly when fully mature. They grow in large, beautiful clusters that provide both visual drama and substantial yield.

**2. The Bold Flavor Specialist**
This mushroom's intense flavor and sturdy texture make it ideal for dishes where it can be the star ingredient.
- **Seafood Substitute:** The premier use - sliced and seared as a stunning, flavorful substitute for scallops or shrimp, where its color and seafood-like sweetness shine.
- **Bacon Alternative:** Thinly sliced and baked or pan-fried until crisp, it creates a vibrant, smoky vegan "bacon" with remarkable flavor depth.
- **Grilled and Barbecued:** Its firm flesh holds up perfectly on the grill, developing a delicious char without falling apart.
- **Rich Stocks and Bisques:** Adds a deep, reddish color and profound umami to broths, perfect for seafood bisques or ramen.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Candy-Cap’ is a rapid, heat-tolerant fruiter that performs exceptionally well in warm balcony conditions. Harvest when clusters are full but caps are still convex and brightly colored. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a **fast, heavy yield of 500–800g of vibrant pink mushrooms in its first flush, with fruits maturing rapidly in 5-7 days after pinning, often producing a substantial second flush.**
