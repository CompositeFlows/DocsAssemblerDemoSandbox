###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Micro-Lingzhi’ is intensely and characteristically bitter, a direct indicator of its high triterpenoid content, with a woody, earthy undertone. It is far too tough and corky to be eaten directly. The fruiting bodies are composed mainly of deep red, antler-like branches with a varnished, zonated appearance, growing 8-12 cm tall. The surface develops a conspicuous, reddish-brown spore dust when mature.

**2. The Functional Tonic Specialist**
This Reishi’s value is derived entirely from its medicinal compounds, extracted for holistic wellness support.
- **Dual-Extraction Tinctures:** The premier use - sliced and subjected to both hot water and high-proof alcohol extraction to capture the full spectrum of beta-glucans (water-soluble) and triterpenes (alcohol-soluble).
- **Decoctions and Teas:** Thin slices or powdered fruiting body are simmered for hours to make a deeply bitter, traditional medicinal tea.
- **Functional Powder:** Dried and finely ground to be encapsulated or added to superfood blends, though the bitterness is potent.
- **Broth and Soup Base:** A small piece can be added to broths and medicinal soups, imparting its beneficial compounds and a characteristic bitter note.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Micro-Lingzhi’ is a slow, steady grower that fruits in warm conditions. Harvest when the antlers have ceased growing in length and the white growing tip has been replaced by the hard, glossy red surface and the spore release has begun. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a **focused yield of 2-4 dense, antlered fruiting bodies per block, with a total dry weight of 50-100g of premium medicinal material after a growth period of 8-12 weeks.**
