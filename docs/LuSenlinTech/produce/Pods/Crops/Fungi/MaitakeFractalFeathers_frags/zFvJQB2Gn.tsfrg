###### The Science & Story Behind It

The achievement of ‘Fractal Feathers’ lies in its miniaturized yet complex morphology and preserved biochemical profile.
- The perfectly proportioned, dwarfed fractal structure is a result of selecting for genetics that control the size and density of the frond initiation points (pilei), creating a condensed version of the wild morphology without sacrificing the intricate, overlapping pattern.
- Its rich, peppery aroma and savory depth are linked to a conserved profile of volatile compounds like 1-octen-3-ol and various sesquiterpenes, ensuring the cultivated form matches the wild foraging experience.
- The ability to form a complete, dense fruiting body on an artificial substrate is a significant breeding accomplishment, as Maitake is notoriously particular about its growing medium; this was achieved by selecting strains with enhanced enzyme systems to fully utilize the nutrients in a supplemented hardwood sawdust block.

In short, **Maitake ‘Fractal Feathers’** is a **flavor-potent, structurally exquisite, and space-adapted** gourmet mushroom, a horticultural marvel that brings the legendary taste and breathtaking form of the "dancing mushroom" to the urban gardener's doorstep.
