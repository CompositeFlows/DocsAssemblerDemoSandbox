###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘City-Top’ offers a deep, nutty flavor reminiscent of roasted chestnuts with a subtle, peppery finish and a firm, substantial bite. The caps are 3-6 cm in diameter, convex to broadly umbonate, with a vibrant reddish-brown color and darker, fibrous scales. The flesh is thick, firm, and white, retaining its texture beautifully during cooking. The mushrooms grow in tight, overlapping clusters that are both visually striking and highly productive.

**2. The Nutty, Meaty All-Rounder**
This mushroom's robust flavor and texture make it exceptionally versatile for a wide range of cooking methods.
- **Sautéed and Roasted:** The premier method - sliced and sautéed with butter or roasted with herbs to develop a deep, nutty flavor and a satisfyingly chewy texture.
- **Soups and Stews:** Adds a rich, earthy depth and meaty substance to broths, stews, and grain dishes, holding its shape well during long simmering.
- **Risotto and Pasta:** Its firm texture and nutty notes make it an excellent addition to creamy risottos and pasta dishes, where it provides a pleasant contrast.
- **Pickled and Preserved:** Young, firm buttons can be pickled, creating a flavorful, textured condiment with a unique nutty-peppery profile.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘City-Top’ is a vigorous colonizer and reliable fruiter. Harvest clusters when the caps are mostly expanded but the edges are still slightly incurred; the partial veil often leaves a fragile, cobwebby ring on the stem. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a **substantial and visually impressive yield of 600–900g of dense, flavorful mushrooms over 2-3 heavy flushes, with the first harvest ready 10-15 days after initiating fruiting conditions.**
