###### The Science & Story Behind It

The elegance of ‘Metro-Needle’ is a product of its balanced response to environmental cues and stabilized morphology.
- The development of the desirable golden caps and velvety stems (traits of natural, low-CO2 growth) has been stabilized in this strain, allowing it to fruit with these characteristics even without the extreme environmental control used in commercial production.
- Its ability to fruit reliably in the variable conditions of a balcony is due to selection for strains with a broader tolerance for lower humidity and higher light levels, which would normally inhibit or deform enoki pinning.
- The crisp texture and delicate cell structure are maintained by selecting for a specific balance of chitin and water content in the cell walls, ensuring the mushroom has its signature "snap" without being tough or fibrous.

In short, **Enoki ‘Metro-Needle’** is a **graceful, flavor-delicate, and condition-adapted** cultivar, a return to the elegant form and texture of wild enoki that thrives in the unique microclimate of the urban garden.
