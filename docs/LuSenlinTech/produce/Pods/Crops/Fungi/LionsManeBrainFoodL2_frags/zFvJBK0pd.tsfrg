‘BrainFood L-2’ is a high-potency, compact-fruiting strain of Lion’s Mane (*Hericium erinaceus*) specifically selected for both robust balcony production and enhanced neuroprotective compound content. This cultivar produces dense, snow-white pom-pom formations with exceptionally long, delicate spines, offering superior texture and a higher concentration of bioactive compounds than standard varieties. ‘BrainFood L-2’ delivers the signature delicate, seafood-like flavor of Lion’s Mane while providing maximum functional benefits from a space-efficient growth habit.
