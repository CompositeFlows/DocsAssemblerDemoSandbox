###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Brown Beech Nano’ offers a sophisticated and aromatic flavor profile: distinct notes of fresh almond, a subtle poplar-like woodiness, and a clean, white wine finish. The caps are 2-4 cm in diameter, perfectly convex with a smooth, hygrophanous surface that transitions from caramel to rich brown. The stems are slender, fibrous, and pale, supporting tight clusters that resemble a miniature deciduous forest. The texture is firm yet tender, with none of the sliminess found in some related species.

**2. The Aromatic Gourmet Specialty**
This mushroom's complex aroma and elegant form make it ideal for dishes where its subtle flavors can shine.
- **Sautéed in Butter:** The premier preparation - gently cooked in butter to preserve its delicate almond and wine-like notes, often served as a simple side or over toast.
- **Omelets and Egg Dishes:** Finely chopped and added to omelets, frittatas, or scrambled eggs, where its nutty flavor complements the richness of the eggs.
- **Creamy Sauces and Risottos:** Adds a layer of sophisticated, aromatic depth to white wine cream sauces and risottos without overpowering other ingredients.
- **Grilled or Broiled:** Brushed with olive oil and grilled briefly, developing a slight smokiness that enhances its inherent nutty character.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Brown Beech Nano’ is a rapid, generous fruiter that produces multiple, successive clusters. Harvest entire clusters by twisting at the base when the caps are mostly convex but before the edges fully flatten and the spores begin to drop. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides an **abundant yield of numerous dense clusters totaling 400–700g over 3-4 rapid flushes, with the first harvest ready just 7-12 days after initiating fruiting conditions.**
