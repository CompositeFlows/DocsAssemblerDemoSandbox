‘Amber Slick’ is a distinctive, gelatinous-cap strain of Nameko (*Pholiota nameko*) celebrated for its authentic texture and robust flavor. This cultivar produces charming clusters of small, convex caps in warm shades of amber and orange-brown, covered in the signature thick, natural gelatinous coating that gives Nameko its name and unique culinary appeal. Selected for reliable fruiting on enriched substrate blocks, ‘Amber Slick’ delivers the classic, rich, earthy flavor and slippery texture essential to traditional Japanese cuisine, all within a compact, balcony-friendly format.
