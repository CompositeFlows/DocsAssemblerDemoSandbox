###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Amber Slick’ offers a rich, earthy, and slightly nutty flavor with a distinct umami depth that forms the foundation of many Japanese dishes. The caps are small (2-4 cm), smooth, and range from honey-amber to rusty brown, topped with a thick, clear gelatinous layer. The stems are slender and firm, supporting clusters of mushrooms that glisten as if freshly glazed. The texture is the defining feature - slippery and smooth when cooked, yet retaining a pleasant firmness.

**2. The Essential Japanese Soup Mushroom**
This mushroom's unique texture and foundational flavor make it indispensable for specific traditional and modern applications.
- **Miso Soup and Nabe:** The premier use - added to miso soup, nabe (hot pot), and ramen where its slippery texture and rich flavor are considered essential, thickening the broth slightly as it cooks.
- **Soba and Udon Topping:** Simmered in a soy-based sauce (nameko no tsukudani) and served over noodles, providing a savory, glutinous topping.
- **Rice and Donburi:** Mixed into steamed rice or served over rice bowls (donburi), where its gelatinous quality adds moisture and binds ingredients.
- **Tempura:** Lightly battered and fried, creating a contrast between the crisp exterior and the uniquely soft, slippery interior.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Amber Slick’ fruits in dense, picturesque clusters in cool, humid conditions. Harvest entire clusters when the caps are fully formed and the gelatinous layer is most prominent. Supplied as a pre-colonized MycoBlock™, it provides a **moderate but high-quality yield of 300–500g of glossy, authentic Nameko over 2-3 flushes, with the first harvest ready 14-20 days after initiating fruiting conditions.**
