###### The Science & Story Behind It

The purity of ‘Snow Cluster’ stems from its stable albino characteristics and optimized growth structure.
- The consistent, bright white coloration is a result of a selected mutation that suppresses melanin production in the fruiting body, a trait that has been stabilized to prevent reversion to pigmented forms.
- Its sweet, nutty flavor profile, distinct from the slightly bitter notes of some brown shimeji, is linked to a different balance of free amino acids and a lower concentration of certain terpenoids, achieved through targeted selective breeding.
- The ability to form such dense, uniform clusters is a trait selected for efficient resource allocation, ensuring the mycelial network initiates a high number of primordia in a synchronized manner, leading to the characteristic "bouquet" appearance.

In short, **Shimeji ‘Snow Cluster’** is a **mild, crisp, and visually pristine** gourmet mushroom, a refined cultivar that offers a cleaner, sweeter alternative to traditional shimeji, perfect for elevating the urban gourmet's palette with both its beauty and its subtle, sophisticated flavor.
