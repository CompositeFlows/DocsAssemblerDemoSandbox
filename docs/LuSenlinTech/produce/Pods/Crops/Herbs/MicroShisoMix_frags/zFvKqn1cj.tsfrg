##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
This mix offers a dramatic flavour punch from tiny leaves. The **Green Shiso** is bright, minty-citrus with hints of cinnamon and anise. The **Red Shiso** is more robust, with deeper cinnamon and bitter notes, and a stunning anthocyanin-rich burgundy colour that acts as a natural dye. Both are harvested as delicate, coin-sized micro-leaves.

###### 2. The Ultimate Umami Garnish
These micro-leaves are designed for maximum impact in minimalist applications.
- **Sushi & Sashimi:** The classic use. A single green shiso leaf under a piece of sashimi or in a hand roll cleanses the palate and complements the fish perfectly. Red shiso is traditionally used to colour and flavour umeboshi (pickled plums).
- **Salads & Garnishes:** A handful scattered over a salad, ceviche, or cold noodle dishes adds an unforgettable, complex aroma and a burst of colour.
- **Cocktails & Infusions:** Used as an aromatic garnish for cocktails or infused into vinegar, soy sauce, or salt to impart their unique flavour profile.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
Grown as a cut-and-come-again micro-green, the mix is harvested with scissors just above the soil line when the first true leaves appear. Supplied as a dedicated RFID seed pad, it provides **multiple dense harvests of 20–30g of mixed micro-shiso from a single bay over a 2-3 week period.**
