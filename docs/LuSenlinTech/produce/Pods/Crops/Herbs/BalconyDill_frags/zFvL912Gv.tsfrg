##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Frond-Flash’ offers the classic, clean dill profile: a bright, grassy flavour with distinct notes of anise, lemon, and a subtle celery-like freshness. Its foliage is finely dissected, feathery, and a vibrant light green, growing on a sturdy, self-supporting plant that remains productive for weeks longer than common dill.

###### 2. The Bright, Fresh Finisher
This dill is the quintessential herb for adding a fresh, lively note to a wide array of dishes, particularly those from Northern and Eastern European cuisines.
- **The Seafood Partner:** The indispensable garnish for gravlax (cured salmon) and a key flavour in creamy sauces for poached fish, shrimp, and scallops.
- **Salads & Dips:** A vital component in potato salads, cucumber salads, tzatziki, and sour cream-based dips, where its bright flavour cuts through richness.
- **Pickling & Preserving:** While bred for leaf production, if allowed to eventually flower, its umbels are perfect for flavourful pickling of cucumbers, beans, and other vegetables.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a fast-growing annual with a strong, central focus on foliage. Harvest the outer, feathery fronds regularly, allowing the central growing point to continue producing new leaves. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **rapid and continuous yield of 20–40g of delicate fronds per week for an extended season before it finally decides to bolt.**
