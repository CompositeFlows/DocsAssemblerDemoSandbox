##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Metro-Pak Chee’ offers the distinct, robust coriander profile cherished in Thai cooking: a powerful citrus-cumin note with a bold, almost peppery intensity, and significantly less of the "soapy" aldehyde that some find disagreeable. The plant forms a dense, low rosette of large, serrated leaves, staying productive for months.

###### 2. The Soul of Southeast Asian Cooking
This coriander is the indispensable fresh herb for a vast array of dishes.
- **Curries & Soups:** A mandatory garnish for Thai green and red curries, *Tom Yum*, and *Tom Kha Gai* soups, where its bright, citrusy flavour cuts through the richness and spice.
- **Salads & Relishes:** The key ingredient in salads like *Yum Som O* (pomelo salad) and fresh relishes, providing a fresh, pungent counterpoint to sweet, sour, and spicy notes.
- **Herb Garnish:** Used in vast quantities as a bed for grilled meats and as a final flourish on noodle dishes like *Pad Thai*, to be mixed in at the table.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a slow-bolting, multi-branching variety. Harvest the larger outer leaves regularly, allowing the central growing point to continue producing. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 25–40g of large, potent leaves per week for an extended season.**
