###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Petit Bourguignon’ stems from its extended maturation and specialized metabolism.
- The enhanced flavor complexity results from selective breeding for snails with slower metabolic rates, allowing for greater development of flavor compounds and superior texture formation.
- The cold tolerance is achieved through selecting for individuals with efficient energy utilization at lower temperatures, making them ideal for unheated balcony environments in temperate climates.
- Their thicker shells and robust constitution are bred traits that reduce mortality and improve survival during handling and transport, ensuring a premium product reaches the table.

In short, **Burgundy Snail ‘Petit Bourguignon’** is a **flavor-complex, cold-adapted, and quality-focused** cultivar, a snail that embodies the gastronomic heritage of French cuisine while adapting gracefully to urban cultivation.
