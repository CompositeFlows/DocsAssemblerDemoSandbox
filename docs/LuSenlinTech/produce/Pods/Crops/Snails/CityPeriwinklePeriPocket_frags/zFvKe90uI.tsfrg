###### The Science & Story Behind It

The success of ‘Peri-Pocket’ lies in its environmental resilience and flavor concentration.
- The intense flavor concentration results from selective breeding for efficient mineral uptake from seawater and optimal conversion of algal diets into the signature briny-sweet taste compounds.
- Their tolerance to artificial seawater conditions is achieved through selecting for individuals with robust osmoregulatory systems that handle the stable salinity of recirculating systems better than wild counterparts.
- The compact size and rapid maturation are bred traits that allow for high-density culture while maintaining the authentic flavor profile of larger, wild periwinkles.

In short, **City Periwinkle ‘Peri-Pocket’** is a **flavor-intense, space-efficient, and remarkably hardy** cultivar, bringing the authentic taste of the rocky shoreline to urban haloponic systems with reliable production and minimal space requirements.
