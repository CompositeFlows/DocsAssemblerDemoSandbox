‘Brown-Line Nano’ is a prolific, strikingly patterned strain of garden snail (*Cornu aspersum*) developed for high-density urban production and visual appeal. This cultivar displays the signature brown and tan striped patterning of its species but in a compact 2-2.5 cm shell diameter, with the stripes intensified to a dramatic, high-contrast appearance. Selected for rapid reproduction and efficient feed conversion, ‘Brown-Line Nano’ delivers a balanced, mildly earthy flavor with a tender texture, making it an excellent all-purpose snail for both traditional and innovative cuisine.
