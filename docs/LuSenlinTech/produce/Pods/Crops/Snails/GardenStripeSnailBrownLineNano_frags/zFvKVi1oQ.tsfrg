###### The Science & Story Behind It

The productivity of ‘Brown-Line Nano’ stems from its accelerated lifecycle and stabilized ornamental traits.
- The rapid growth and reproduction are achieved through selective breeding for early sexual maturity and efficient nutrient partitioning to both shell development and meat production.
- The intensified stripe patterning is a result of selecting for maximum pigment expression in the shell proteins, a trait that correlates with overall shell strength and animal vitality.
- Their adaptability to diverse food sources and resistance to common pathogens make them exceptionally well-suited for the variable conditions of urban farming.

In short, **Garden Stripe Snail ‘Brown-Line Nano’** is a **rapid-cycling, visually distinctive, and culinary-versatile** cultivar, a workhorse snail that combines ornamental beauty with reliable production for the urban heliciculturist.
