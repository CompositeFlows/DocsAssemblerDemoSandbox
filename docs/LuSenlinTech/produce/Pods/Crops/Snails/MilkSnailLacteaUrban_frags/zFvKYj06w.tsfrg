‘Lactea Urban’ is a delicate, porcelain-white strain of milk snail (*Otala lactea*) selected for its elegant appearance and refined flavor profile in urban cultivation. This cultivar develops the characteristic flattened, globular shell in a pristine, nearly pure white coloration with subtle translucent qualities, reaching a dainty 2-3 cm diameter. Bred for its exceptionally tender texture and clean, mild flavor, ‘Lactea Urban’ offers a sophisticated snail experience that highlights subtlety over intensity, making it perfect for delicate preparations and raw applications.
