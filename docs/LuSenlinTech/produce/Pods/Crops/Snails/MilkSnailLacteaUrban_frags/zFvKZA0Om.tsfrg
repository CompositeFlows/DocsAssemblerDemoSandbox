###### The Science & Story Behind It

The distinction of ‘Lactea Urban’ lies in its enhanced shell composition and refined texture development.
- The pure white, semi-translucent shell results from selective breeding for specific calcium carbonate crystallization patterns and reduced pigmentation, creating both visual appeal and a slightly thinner, more delicate shell structure.
- The exceptionally tender texture is achieved through breeding for a unique muscle fiber composition with lower collagen content, resulting in a melt-in-the-mouth quality when properly prepared.
- Their sensitivity to environmental conditions, while requiring more careful cultivation, ensures that only the highest-quality specimens reach harvest, guaranteeing a premium product.

In short, **Milk Snail ‘Lactea Urban’** is a **texture-delicate, flavor-subtle, and visually-elegant** cultivar, a specialty snail that brings a touch of refined sophistication to urban heliciculture, perfect for the discerning chef seeking the ultimate in delicate snail cuisine.
