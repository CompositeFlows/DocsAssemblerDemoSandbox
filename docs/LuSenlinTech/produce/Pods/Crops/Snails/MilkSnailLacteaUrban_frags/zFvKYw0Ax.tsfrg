###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Lactea Urban’ offers a remarkably clean, mild flavor with subtle mineral notes and a hint of fresh greens. The texture is exceptionally tender - almost delicate - with none of the chewiness found in larger snail species. The meat is pale, nearly translucent when raw, cooking to a soft, yielding consistency. The shells are the standout feature: porcelain-white with a semi-translucent quality that gives them an ethereal, milky appearance.

**2. The Delicate, Elegant Specialty**
This snail's subtle flavor and tender texture make it ideal for applications where delicacy and presentation are paramount.
- **Raw Snail Crudo:** The premier preparation - sliced paper-thin and served raw with high-quality olive oil, sea salt, and micro-herbs to highlight its natural delicacy.
- **Lightly Poached in Broth:** Gently poached in a delicate vegetable or chicken broth, preserving their tender texture and mild flavor.
- **White Wine and Herb Steaming:** Steamed briefly with white wine and fresh herbs, creating a light, aromatic dish where the snail's subtlety can shine.
- **Salad and Canapé Garnish:** Provides elegant, bite-sized morsels for composed salads or as a sophisticated topping for canapés.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Lactea Urban’ thrives in stable, moderate conditions and is particularly sensitive to water quality and diet, requiring clean greens and calcium sources. They grow at a steady, moderate pace. In a carefully maintained Haloponic™, a colony provides a **refined yield of 100-150 pristine snails per month, reaching optimal delicacy and size of 2.5 cm in 9-11 weeks from hatching.**
