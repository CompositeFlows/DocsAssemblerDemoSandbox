‘Neri-Snack’ is a dazzling, hardworking strain of nerite snail (*Neritina natalensis*) developed for dual-purpose functionality in urban marine systems. This cultivar displays the signature bold, zebra-like black and gold stripes on a compact, semi-spherical shell reaching 1.5-2 cm in diameter. While serving as an exceptionally efficient algae grazer that keeps aquarium surfaces pristine, ‘Neri-Snack’ simultaneously develops a surprisingly sweet, concentrated flavor, making it both a premier cleanup crew and a unique gourmet garnish for sophisticated seafood presentations.
