###### The Science & Story Behind It

The dual excellence of ‘Neri-Snack’ lies in its enhanced pigmentation and optimized grazing efficiency.
- The intense, stable striping results from selective breeding for maximum pigment expression in the periostracum layer, creating both ornamental value and a marker of overall health and shell integrity.
- The concentrated sweet flavor develops from their efficient conversion of diverse algal films into glycogen and flavor compounds, enhanced by breeding for optimal nutrient partitioning.
- Their inability to reproduce in pure seawater while maintaining vigorous grazing activity makes them ideal for controlled urban systems where population management is essential.

In short, **Striped Nerite ‘Neri-Snack’** is a **visually-striking, flavor-concentrated, and ecologically-safe** cultivar, the perfect fusion of form and function that brings both impeccable aquarium maintenance and gourmet garnishes to urban marine aquaculture.
