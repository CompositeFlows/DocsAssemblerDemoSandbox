‘Protein Pearl’ is a robust, dual-purpose strain of mystery snail (*Pomacea diffusa*) selected for both exceptional aquarium cleaning efficiency and high-quality protein production. This cultivar develops the classic globular shell in a range of natural colors - gold, ivory, blue, and chestnut - with a compact 3-4 cm diameter. While tirelessly grazing on algae and detritus to maintain water quality, ‘Protein Pearl’ simultaneously develops sweet, firm meat with a flavor profile that bridges freshwater prawns and land snails, making it the ultimate utilitarian mollusk for integrated aquaponic systems.
