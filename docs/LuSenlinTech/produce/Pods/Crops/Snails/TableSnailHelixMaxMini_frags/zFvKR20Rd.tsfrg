###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Helix Max-Mini’ offers the quintessential escargot profile: a rich, earthy flavor with subtle mushroom and herbaceous notes, and a tender yet pleasantly resilient texture. The meat is firm and beige when raw, becoming succulent and absorbing flavors beautifully when cooked. The shells are perfectly formed, with the classic spherical shape and creamy background with subtle brown banding, just in a miniature, elegant scale.

**2. The Classic Escargot, Perfected**
This snail's traditional flavor and perfect single-bite size make it ideal for both classic and innovative preparations.
- **Classic Garlic-Herb Butter:** The premier preparation - baked in their shells with generous garlic-parsley butter, creating the authentic French bistro experience.
- **Snail Pâté and Terrines:** Creates exceptionally smooth, flavorful pâtés due to their tender texture and rich flavor concentration.
- **Pasta and Risotto:** Chopped and incorporated into creamy sauces, where they provide bursts of earthy flavor.
- **Snail Skewers or Brochettes:** Their uniform size makes them perfect for threading onto skewers with vegetables and grilling.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Helix Max-Mini’ thrives in humid, controlled environments with a balanced diet of organic greens and calcium supplement. They are prolific breeders, ensuring a continuous harvest cycle. In a Haloponic™ Snail Frame, a starter colony of 50 individuals can expand to provide a **sustainable yield of 200-300 harvest-ready snails per month, reaching optimal size of 2.5 cm in just 8-10 weeks from hatching.**
