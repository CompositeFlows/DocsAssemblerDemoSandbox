‘Helix Max-Mini’ is a dwarf, high-yield strain of the classic Roman snail (*Helix pomatia*) engineered for efficient urban heliciculture. This cultivar condenses the prized qualities of its larger relatives into a compact 2-3 cm shell diameter, while intensifying the rich, earthy flavor and tender texture that define premium escargot. Selected for rapid growth and prolific breeding in controlled environments, ‘Helix Max-Mini’ delivers a consistent, gourmet product from a minimal footprint, making traditional snail cultivation accessible to the urban farmer.
