‘Giant Prawn Jr.’ is a precisely scaled-down strain of the Giant River Prawn (*Macrobrachium rosenbergii*) that captures all the desirable traits of its famous parent at exactly half the linear dimensions. This cultivar exhibits the characteristic long blue claws, substantial antennae, and pearlescent body of standard *M. rosenbergii*, but matures at a compact 12-15 cm total length. It delivers the same sweet, rich flavor and firm texture that makes the giant prawn a premium product, but in a perfectly portioned size optimized for high-density urban aquaculture.
