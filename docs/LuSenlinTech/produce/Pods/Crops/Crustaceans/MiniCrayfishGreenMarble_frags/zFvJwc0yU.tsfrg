###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Green-Marble’ offers a classic crayfish flavor: sweet, rich, and slightly earthy with a firm, succulent texture in the tail meat. The claws, while smaller than those of large crayfish, contain sweet, tender morsels. The meat is white with a pink blush when cooked. The live animal is a visual marvel, with each individual displaying a unique marble pattern of greens and blacks against a translucent base.

**2. The Perfectly Portioned Crustacean**
This crayfish's individual size makes it ideal for dishes where whole presentation is desired, or for applications where larger crayfish would be impractical.
- **Whole Boiled or Steamed:** The premier preparation - cooked whole in a seasoned broth, served as a individual portion. The vibrant shell turns a brilliant red-orange, creating a stunning contrast to the green-tinged raw state.
- **Crayfish Étouffée:** The tail meat is perfectly sized for this classic Cajun dish, absorbing the rich, spicy sauce while maintaining its texture.
- **Pasta and Risotto:** Shelled tail meat adds sweet, briny flavor to creamy pasta dishes and risottos, with several tails providing a perfect serving.
- **Crayfish Butter:** The shells and bodies can be used to make a deeply flavored, aromatic compound butter for finishing sauces or spreading on bread.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Green-Marble’ is a rapid-growing, prolific parthenogenetic species. Each individual can produce clones without mating, leading to exponential population growth in optimal conditions. In a dedicated AquaPod with ample hiding places, a starter colony can provide a **sustainable, continuous harvest of 15-25 individual crayfish per month from a 30-liter system, reaching optimal harvest size of 8 cm in just 10-12 weeks from hatch.**
