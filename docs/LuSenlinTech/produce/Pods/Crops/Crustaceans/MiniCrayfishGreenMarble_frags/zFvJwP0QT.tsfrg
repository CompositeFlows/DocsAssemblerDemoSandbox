‘Green-Marble’ is a dwarf, marbled crayfish (*Procambarus virginalis*) strain selected for its striking appearance and manageable size in container aquaculture. This parthenogenetic cultivar reproduces clonally, ensuring consistent coloration and growth patterns across generations. It displays a beautiful mosaic of olive green, dark emerald, and black marbling across its carapace and claws, creating a living marble sculpture. Reaching a harvest size of 7-9 cm, ‘Green-Marble’ delivers a sweet, rich flavor comparable to its larger crayfish relatives, but in a perfectly portioned package.
