###### The Science & Story Behind It

The consistency of ‘Green-Marble’ is rooted in its unique reproductive biology and selected morphological traits.
- The parthenogenetic reproduction ensures every offspring is genetically identical to the parent, guaranteeing consistent marbled patterning, growth rate, and flavor profile across the entire population.
- The dwarf size is a naturally occurring trait in this clonal line that has been stabilized through selective culling of larger variants, creating a population that reliably matures at the desired plate size.
- The vibrant green marbling is the result of selective breeding for specific chromatophore distribution and density, creating the distinctive appearance while maintaining the hardiness required for aquaculture.

In short, **Mini Crayfish ‘Green-Marble’** is a **self-sustaining, visually striking, and flavor-authentic** cultivar, a clonal marvel that provides both endless fascination and a reliable harvest of sweet, succulent crustacean meat from a compact urban system.
