###### The Science & Story Behind It

The effectiveness of ‘CleanSweep Urban’ is a product of enhanced feeding behavior and physiological resilience.
- The superior algae-cleaning efficiency stems from selecting for individuals with more robust maxillipeds (feeding appendages) and a more persistent grazing behavior, making them significantly more effective at controlling tough algae like hair and thread algae.
- Its resilience to fluctuations in pH and temperature - common in smaller-volume balcony systems - is achieved by selecting for shrimp from lines that have acclimated to a wider range of conditions, making them far hardier than wild-caught specimens.
- The increased maximum size is a result of selective breeding for delayed maturation and efficient nutrient uptake, allowing them to grow larger before their growth plateaus.

In short, **Amano Shrimp ‘CleanSweep Urban’** is a **high-efficiency, resilient, and flavor-robust** cultivar, the ultimate specialist janitor for the urban food ecosystem, providing invaluable maintenance services with a savory, umami-rich harvest as a rewarding bonus.
