###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Soft-Shell Micro’ offers an exceptionally sweet, delicate crab flavor with none of the shell toughness of hard-shell varieties. The entire animal - including legs, body, and claws - is edible when harvested at the perfect post-molt moment. The flesh is tender and moist, while the temporary shell fries to a delicate, potato-chip-like crispness. Live crabs appear pale, soft, and slightly translucent during the harvest window.

**2. The Ultimate Fried Delicacy**
This crab's unique edible quality during its soft-shell phase makes it ideally suited for quick, high-heat cooking methods that highlight its texture.
- **Deep-Fried Whole:** The classic preparation - dredged in seasoned flour and deep-fried until golden and crisp, creating a contrast between the crunchy exterior and tender interior.
- **Soft-Shell Crab Sandwiches:** Served on a bun with lettuce, tomato, and remoulade sauce as a gourmet sandwich filling.
- **Tempura-Style:** Dipped in light tempura batter and fried, resulting in an exceptionally airy, crisp coating that lets the sweet crab flavor shine.
- **Sautéed in Butter:** Quickly sautéed in brown butter with capers and lemon, allowing the delicate shell to become buttery and crisp.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Soft-Shell Micro’ is maintained in specialized molting systems that allow for careful monitoring of individual crabs. Harvest occurs during the brief 2-4 hour window after molting, before the new shell begins to harden. In a dedicated Soft-Shell Pod system, a rotating population provides a **continuous yield of 8-12 perfect soft-shell crabs per week from a 45-liter unit, with crabs reaching the ideal molting size of 7 cm in 10-12 weeks.**
