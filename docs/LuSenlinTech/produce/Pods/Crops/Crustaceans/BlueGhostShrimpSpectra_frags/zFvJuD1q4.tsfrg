‘Spectra’ is a stunning, selectively bred strain of ghost shrimp (*Palaemonetes paludosus*) prized for its ethereal, translucent blue coloration and dual-purpose functionality. This cultivar combines the efficient scavenging capabilities of its wild ancestors with a striking visual appeal and a larger, more substantial body. Reaching a harvest size of 4-5 cm, ‘Spectra’ appears as a shimmering, blue-tinted phantom in the water, constantly working to clean the system while providing delicate, sweet morsels for the table.
