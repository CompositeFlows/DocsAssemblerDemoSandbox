###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Blue Marronette’ stems from its stabilized pigmentation and selected growth characteristics.
- The intense, stable blue coloration results from selective breeding for maximum expression of crustacyanin proteins that bind with astaxanthin to create the blue pigment, a trait that has been stabilized across generations.
- The compact size while maintaining excellent meat yield is achieved through selecting for a deep-bodied morphology with a shortened abdomen, concentrating growth in the meat-rich tail section.
- The exceptional sweetness and clean flavor are enhanced by maintaining the crustaceans on a controlled diet free of compounds that can cause off-flavors, while selecting for individuals with efficient nutrient conversion to muscle tissue.

In short, **Mini Marron ‘Blue Marronette’** is a **color-stable, flavor-superior, and portion-perfect** cultivar, a premium freshwater crustacean that brings the luxury of Australian marron within practical reach of urban aquaculture while offering breathtaking visual appeal.
