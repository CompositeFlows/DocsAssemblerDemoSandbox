###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Pocket-Lob’ offers an astonishingly rich, sweet flavor profile with distinct oceanic notes and a firm, springy texture that closely resembles cold-water lobster. The meat is pearly white with a delicate pink blush when cooked. The animal itself is perfectly proportioned with substantial claws relative to its body, ensuring excellent meat yield. Its compact size makes it the ultimate single-serving lobster.

**2. The Personal Luxury Crustacean**
This lobster's perfect individual portion size and premium quality make it ideal for upscale presentations where whole crustaceans are featured.
- **Whole Steamed or Boiled:** The premier preparation - cooked whole and served with drawn butter as a stunning individual entrée, allowing for the full, luxurious lobster experience without waste.
- **Lobster Roll Filling:** One 'Pocket-Lob' provides the perfect amount of meat for a single, premium lobster roll, dressed lightly in mayo and celery.
- **Butter-Poached Tails:** The tails are ideal for butter-poaching, resulting in incredibly tender, rich meat that melts in the mouth.
- **Grilled with Herb Butter:** Split lengthwise, brushed with herb butter, and grilled until just cooked through, creating a beautiful presentation with smoky notes.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Pocket-Lob’ exhibits a synchronized growth pattern, with populations reaching harvest size within a narrow window. They thrive in well-oxygenated, clean water systems with plenty of hiding spaces. In a specialized Lobster-Pod system, a cohort provides a **concentrated harvest of 15-20 perfectly sized lobsters per 35-liter unit, reaching the target two-finger tail size in 16-20 weeks from juvenile stage.**
