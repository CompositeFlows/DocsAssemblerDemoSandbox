‘Dual-Bite’ is a high-performance, selectively bred strain of Neocaridina shrimp (*Neocaridina davidi*) that excels in the dual roles of aquarium cleaner and protein producer. This cultivar displays an intense, solid red coloration and is bred for both prolific breeding and a larger-than-typical body size. While continuously grazing on biofilm and detritus to maintain system cleanliness, ‘Dual-Bite’ reaches a substantial harvest size of 2.5-3.5 cm, offering sweet, tender morsels perfect for small-plate delicacies.
