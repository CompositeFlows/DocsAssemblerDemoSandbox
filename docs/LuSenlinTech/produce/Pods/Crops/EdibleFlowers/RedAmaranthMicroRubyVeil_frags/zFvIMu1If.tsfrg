‘Ruby Veil’ is a spectacular microgreen cultivar of red amaranth, selected for its intense coloration, rapid growth, and nutrient density in confined spaces. This variety produces a dense canopy of blood-red leaves with metallic burgundy undersides and vibrant magenta veins, creating a stunning "veil" of color. Harvested at just 10-15 cm tall, ‘Ruby Veil’ delivers a sweet, earthy flavor with subtle nutty notes and a remarkably tender texture, making it both a visual and culinary standout.
