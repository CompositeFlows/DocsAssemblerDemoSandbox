###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Golden Byte’ delivers a sophisticated flavor profile beginning with the classic saffron-like earthiness of calendula, followed by subtle peppery notes and a hint of citrus. The flowers are fully double, 5-7 cm in diameter, with dense petals in shades of deep orange, bright gold, and buttery yellow. The plant forms a compact, branching mound 20-25 cm tall with lance-shaped, aromatic green leaves.

**2. The Saffron-Alternative & Healing Flower**
This calendula’s rich color and complex flavor make it valuable for both culinary and wellness applications.
- **Rice and Grain Coloring:** The premier culinary use - petals impart a beautiful golden hue and subtle flavor to rice, risottos, and grain dishes as a sustainable saffron alternative.
- **Herbal Teas and Infusions:** Dried or fresh petals create vibrant, golden teas with earthy, soothing flavors and potential anti-inflammatory benefits.
- **Compound Butters and Oils:** Steeped in oils or mixed into butters, they add both color and a subtle peppery-saffron flavor to sauces and spreads.
- **Skin-Salve Base:** The high concentration of triterpenoids and flavonoids makes it ideal for creating healing balms and skin-care infusions.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Golden Byte’ is a continuous bloomer when harvested regularly. Pick flowers when they are fully open but still fresh, preferably in morning after dew has evaporated. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a **consistent yield of 15-25 prime flowers per week, with first harvest beginning 55-60 days after germination and continuing throughout the growing season.**
