‘Sky-Blue’ is a dwarf, compact borage cultivar that captures the iconic celestial beauty and cucumber freshness of traditional borage in a space-conscious form perfect for balcony gardens. This improved variety produces the same stunning, star-shaped blue flowers and fuzzy leaves, but in a controlled, mounding habit that eliminates the sprawling nature of its ancestors. ‘Sky-Blue’ delivers the classic refreshing cucumber flavor with enhanced intensity, making it the ultimate edible flower for culinary and decorative use in confined spaces.
