###### The Science & Story Behind It

The innovation of ‘Sky-Blue’ lies in its controlled growth habit and stabilized pigment production.
- The compact, non-spreading form is achieved through selective breeding for a bushy growth gene and reduced apical dominance, creating a self-supporting plant that doesn't require the staking needed by traditional tall borage varieties.
- The intense blue flower color results from stabilized anthocyanin production specifically for the delphinidin-based pigments that create borage's unique blue hue, ensuring consistent color regardless of environmental conditions.
- The reduced leaf bristliness and enhanced cucumber flavor come from selecting for plants with smaller trichomes and higher concentrations of the aldehyde compounds responsible for fresh cucumber aroma and taste.

In short, **Borage ‘Sky-Blue’** is a **space-adapted, flavor-intense, and perpetually blooming** edible flower, a domesticated version of a classic herb that brings continuous celestial beauty and refreshing flavor to the urban gardener's palette.
