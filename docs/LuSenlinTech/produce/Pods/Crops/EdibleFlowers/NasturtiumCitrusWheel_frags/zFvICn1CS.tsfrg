‘Citrus Wheel’ is a revolutionary dwarf nasturtium cultivar bred specifically for high-density vertical farming and balcony container production. This compact, mounding variety delivers the classic peppery flavor of nasturtiums with a distinctive citrusy zing, all while maintaining a tidy 20-25 cm canopy perfect for tower gardens. Unlike traditional trailing varieties, ‘Citrus Wheel’ produces an abundance of vibrant, circular leaves and semi-double flowers in a continuous cycle, making it both an ornamental delight and a culinary workhorse.
