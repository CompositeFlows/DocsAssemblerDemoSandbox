###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Chop-Chop’ stems from its optimized growth hormones and balanced phytochemical profile.
- The compact, bushy habit with multiple branching points is achieved through selective breeding for enhanced cytokinin production, which promotes lateral growth and delays flowering.
- The refined bitterness level results from selecting for a specific balance of sesquiterpene lactones - the compounds responsible for the characteristic flavor - reducing the harsher notes while maintaining the essential aromatic quality.
- The rapid regrowth capability is engineered through a modified response to cutting stress, allowing the plant to quickly activate axillary buds and regenerate new growth without bolting prematurely.

In short, **Shungiku ‘Chop-Chop’** is a **rapid-cycling, flavor-authentic, and space-optimized** specialty green, a cultivated refinement of a traditional Japanese vegetable that brings continuous harvests of aromatic greens to the urban cook's kitchen.
