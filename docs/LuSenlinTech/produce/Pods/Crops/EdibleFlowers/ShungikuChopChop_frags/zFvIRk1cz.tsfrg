###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Chop-Chop’ offers the classic shungiku profile: a distinctive aromatic flavor with notes of chrysanthemum, mint, and pine, followed by a pleasant, mild bitterness that cleanses the palate. The leaves are deeply serrated, tender, and bright green, growing on multiple branching stems from a central crown. The plant maintains a compact, mounded form that maximizes leaf production in minimal space.

**2. The Essential Hot Pot & Soup Green**
This green's unique flavor and quick-cooking nature make it indispensable in specific culinary applications.
- **Hot Pot Essential:** The premier use - added to soups, nabemono, and hot pots during the final seconds of cooking, where it wilts perfectly and imparts its signature aroma.
- **Ohitashi (Japanese Blanched Salad):** Briefly blanched and dressed with dashi, soy, and bonito flakes to create a classic side dish.
- **Tempura:** Dipped in light batter and quick-fried, which tempers the bitterness while highlighting the herbal notes.
- **Rice and Noodle Enhancer:** Chopped and stirred into steamed rice or noodle dishes during the final moments of cooking.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Chop-Chop’ lives up to its name with remarkably fast regrowth. Harvest by cutting stems 5-7 cm above the base, or pick individual leaves starting from the outside. Supplied as a pre-seeded RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges, it provides a **rapid and abundant yield of 40-60g of aromatic greens per week, with first harvest ready just 30 days after germination and regrowth occurring within 10-14 days of cutting.**
