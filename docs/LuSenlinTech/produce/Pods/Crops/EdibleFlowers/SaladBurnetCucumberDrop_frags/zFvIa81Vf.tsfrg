###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Cucumber Drop’ lies in its stabilized volatile oil production and optimized growth architecture.
- The intense, pure cucumber flavor results from selecting for specific chemotypes with high concentrations of trans-2-hexenal and other cucumber aroma compounds, while minimizing the tannins that can cause bitterness in older leaves.
- The compact, symmetrical growth habit is achieved through breeding for shortened internodes and enhanced apical dominance, creating a plant that maintains its ornamental quality while maximizing leaf production.
- The extended harvest window and reduced flowering tendency come from selecting for day-length insensitivity and temperature-stable growth patterns, ensuring consistent leaf quality throughout the seasons.

In short, **Salad Burnet ‘Cucumber Drop’** is a **flavor-concentrated, space-efficient, and perpetually productive** herb, a refined cultivar that delivers the pure essence of cucumber in a beautiful, balcony-friendly package.
