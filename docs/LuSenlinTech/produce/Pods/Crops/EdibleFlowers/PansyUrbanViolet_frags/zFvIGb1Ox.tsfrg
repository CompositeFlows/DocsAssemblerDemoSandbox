###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Urban-Violet’ stems from its enhanced petal structure and optimized flowering genetics for container production.
- The compact, self-cleaning habit results from a modified growth pattern that directs energy into continuous flower production rather than seed set, creating a plant that blooms persistently without deadheading.
- The thicker, more succulent petals are achieved through selective breeding for enhanced cell wall structure and higher water content in the petal tissues, making them more durable in culinary use and less prone to wilting.
- The mild, sweet flavor profile comes from a balanced anthocyanin and terpene composition that provides visual appeal without the bitter aftertaste found in some ornamental pansies.

In short, **Pansy ‘Urban-Violet’** is a **prolific, sweet-flavored, and container-optimized** edible flower, a specialized cultivar that brings continuous beauty and subtle flavor to the urban gardener's table.
