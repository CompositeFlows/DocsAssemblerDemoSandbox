‘Lemon Arrow’ is a dwarf, perennial sorrel cultivar bred for container living and intense citrus flavor. This compact variety produces a dense clump of arrow-shaped, vibrant green leaves that pack a powerful, clean lemon punch without the excessive oxalic acid sharpness of common sorrel. Reaching just 20-25 cm in height, ‘Lemon Arrow’ maintains a tidy, non-flopping habit and offers year-round harvests of its brightly acidic leaves, making it the ultimate perennial citrus accent for the balcony garden.
