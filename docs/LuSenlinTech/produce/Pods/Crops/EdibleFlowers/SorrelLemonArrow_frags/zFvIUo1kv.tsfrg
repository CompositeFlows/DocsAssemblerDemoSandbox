###### The Science & Story Behind It

The distinction of ‘Lemon Arrow’ lies in its optimized acid profile and compact growth genetics.
- The intense, clean lemon flavor results from selecting for high concentrations of ascorbic acid and specific fruit-acid profiled oxalates, while reducing the harsher oxalic crystals that can create a chalky mouthfeel in common sorrel.
- The compact, upright habit is achieved through breeding for shorter petioles and stronger leaf architecture, creating a plant that resists flopping and maximizes light exposure in dense plantings.
- The extended harvest window and reduced bolting tendency come from selecting for day-length neutrality and temperature-stable growth patterns, allowing consistent leaf production regardless of seasonal changes.

In short, **Sorrel ‘Lemon Arrow’** is a **perennial, intensely citrus, and space-adapted** green, a refined cultivar that delivers year-round bursts of natural lemon flavor from the most compact of growing spaces.
