‘Blue-Ear’ is a dwarf, ornamental-edible strain of abalone (*Haliotis diversicolor*) developed for controlled container aquaculture. This cultivar displays the classic ear-shaped shell but reaches a compact 4-6 cm diameter, with a spectacular iridescent mother-of-pearl interior and a distinctive pattern of vibrant blue respiratory pores along the shell margin. Selected for its manageable size and rapid growth in artificial systems, ‘Blue-Ear’ delivers the rich, buttery-sweet flavor and firm, toothsome texture of premium abalone in a perfectly portioned urban format.
