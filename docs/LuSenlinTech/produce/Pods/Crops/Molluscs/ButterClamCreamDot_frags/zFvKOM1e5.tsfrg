‘Cream-Dot’ is a selectively bred strain of butter clam (*Saxidomus gigantea*) prized for its exceptionally rich, buttery flavor and tender, creamy texture. This cultivar develops a robust, oval shell reaching 4-6 cm in diameter, with a distinctive white to light brown coloration and occasional subtle blue-gray bands. Adapted for life in urban substrate systems, ‘Cream-Dot’ lives up to its name, delivering an unparalleled richness and smooth mouthfeel that melts effortlessly, making it the ultimate choice for chowders and delicate preparations.
