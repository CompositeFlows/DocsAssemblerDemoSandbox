###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Cream-Dot’ offers an intensely rich, buttery flavor with sweet, nutty undertones and a remarkably tender, almost melt-in-your-mouth texture. The meat is plump and pale beige, cooking to a creamy, soft consistency that distinguishes it from chewier clam varieties. The shells are thick and durable with pronounced concentric ridges, providing excellent protection while maintaining an attractive, classic bivalve appearance.

**2. The Rich, Creamy Specialist**
This clam's luxurious texture and deep flavor make it ideal for dishes where silkiness and rich taste are paramount.
- **Premium Clam Chowder:** The premier use - creates an exceptionally velvety, rich chowder where its tender texture and buttery flavor become the star of the dish.
- **Clam Butter and Compound Butters:** The meat blends beautifully into compound butters, creating a decadent spread for bread or finishing sauce for seafood.
- **Gentle Steaming and Poaching:** Cooked gently in their own liquor or light broth to preserve their delicate texture, often served with simple drawn butter.
- **Pasta and Risotto:** Melts into creamy sauces and risottos, imparting a rich, savory depth without overwhelming other ingredients.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Cream-Dot’ is a moderate-paced grower that develops its characteristic richness during the final weeks of maturation. They thrive in mixed sand-shell substrate with consistent, cool water flow. In a Haloponic™ substrate system, a square meter can yield **2-3 kg of premium butter clams over a 10-12 week cycle, reaching optimal richness and size of 5 cm in 9-11 weeks from juvenile seeding.**
