###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Short-Duck’ offers the iconic geoduck flavor: an exceptionally sweet, clean taste often described as a cross between clam and cucumber, with a unique crisp, crunchy texture that is entirely unlike other bivalves. The siphon meat is tender yet remarkably crisp, while the body meat inside the shell is more traditional and creamy. The live animal displays the same remarkable siphon extension behavior as full-sized geoducks, just in miniature scale.

**2. The Crisp Texture Specialist**
This geoduck's unique texture and sweet flavor make it ideal for preparations that highlight its crunchy quality and rapid cooking requirements.
- **Sashimi and Crudo:** The premier preparation - sliced paper-thin and served raw with citrus and light oil, allowing its crisp texture and sweet flavor to shine.
- **Quick Stir-fry or Sauté:** Cut into strips and cooked for mere seconds with high heat to preserve its signature crunch.
- **Ceviche and Pickling:** Its firm structure holds up beautifully to acidic marinades, maintaining crispness while absorbing flavors.
- **Tempura and Light Frying:** The siphon develops a wonderful contrast between crispy batter and crunchy interior when briefly fried.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Short-Duck’ is a deep burrower that thrives in deep sand or sediment beds with strong water flow. Their rapid siphon growth occurs in specialized substrate systems. In a Geoduck-Pod with 30-40 cm sediment depth, a square meter can yield **2-3 kg of premium mini geoducks over a 12-14 week cycle, reaching optimal siphon length of 13 cm in 10-12 weeks from juvenile seeding.**
