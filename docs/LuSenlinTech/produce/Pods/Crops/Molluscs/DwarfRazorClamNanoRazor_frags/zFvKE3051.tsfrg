###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Nano-Razor’ offers the quintessential razor clam profile: a sweet, clean ocean flavor with a distinctive crisp, slightly crunchy texture that sets it apart from other bivalves. The meat is firm and slightly translucent when raw, cooking to a tender yet resilient white. The shells are smooth, glossy, and golden-brown with the characteristic straight razor shape, though proportionally thicker to withstand handling in cultivated systems.

**2. The Crisp-Textured Specialist**
This clam's unique texture and sweet flavor make it ideal for preparations that highlight its crisp bite and rapid cooking time.
- **Quick Sauté or Stir-fry:** The premier preparation - sliced into rings and cooked for mere seconds with garlic and oil to preserve their crisp texture.
- **Tempura or Light Frying:** Their firm structure holds up beautifully to batters, creating a contrast between the crispy coating and crunchy interior.
- **Ceviche and Crudo:** Sliced thin and marinated briefly in citrus, where their natural crispness provides a refreshing mouthfeel.
- **Pasta and Rice Dishes:** Added during the final moments of cooking to paella, risotto, or pasta, where they retain their distinctive bite.

**3. The Harvest & Growth Cycle**
‘Nano-Razor’ is an exceptionally fast burrower, capable of disappearing into substrate in seconds. They thrive in deep, well-oxygenated sand beds with consistent water flow. In a Haloponic™ substrate system, a square meter can yield **2-4 kg of premium razor clams over an 8-10 week cycle, reaching optimal harvest length of 7 cm in as little as 7 weeks from juvenile stage.**
