###### The Science & Story Behind It

The resilience of ‘City Cockle’ stems from its enhanced shell structure and metabolic adaptability.
- The exceptionally hard, thick shell is a result of selective breeding for efficient calcium carbonate deposition and strong conchiolin matrix formation, providing superior protection against predators and handling stress.
- Their tolerance to fluctuating salinity and temperature comes from selecting for cockles with robust osmoregulatory systems and efficient metabolic rate adjustment, making them ideal for the stable yet artificial conditions of urban systems.
- The rapid growth and synchronized maturation are achieved through breeding for highly efficient filtration rates and nutrient conversion, allowing them to reach market size quickly while maintaining consistent quality.

In short, **Hard-Shell Cockle ‘City Cockle’** is a **robust, fast-filtering, and culinary-versatile** cultivar, a workhorse bivalve that combines reliable production with the classic sweet flavor and satisfying texture that has made cockles beloved for generations.
