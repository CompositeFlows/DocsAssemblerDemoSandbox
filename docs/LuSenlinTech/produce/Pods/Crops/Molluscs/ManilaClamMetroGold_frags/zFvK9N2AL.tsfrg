###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Metro-Gold’ stems from its enhanced burrowing efficiency and stabilized pigmentation.
- The rapid growth and uniform size are achieved by selecting for clams with highly efficient siphon systems and metabolic rates optimized for constant feeding in nutrient-rich recirculating systems.
- The distinctive golden shell coloration results from selective breeding for specific mineral deposition patterns in the nacreous layer, creating both visual appeal and a slightly denser shell that withstands handling while remaining easy to open.
- Their synchronized maturation and reduced spawning tendency direct energy toward meat production rather than reproduction, ensuring consistently plump, sweet clams throughout the harvesting window.

In short, **Manila Clam ‘Metro-Gold’** is a **rapid-growing, visually distinctive, and flavor-superior** cultivar, an urban aquaculture specialist that combines water purification efficiency with gourmet quality in a perfectly portioned package.
