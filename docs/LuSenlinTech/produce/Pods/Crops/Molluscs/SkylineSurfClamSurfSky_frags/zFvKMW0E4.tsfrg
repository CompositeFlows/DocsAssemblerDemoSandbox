###### The Science & Story Behind It

The efficiency of ‘Surf-Sky’ stems from its optimized filtration system and controlled growth patterns.
- The rapid growth and uniform size are achieved by selecting for clams with highly efficient siphon systems and synchronized metabolic rates, allowing them to reach market size quickly in nutrient-rich recirculating systems.
- The mild, sweet flavor profile is enhanced through selective breeding for optimal glycogen storage and balanced amino acid composition in the meat.
- Their adaptation to high-density culture comes from breeding for reduced territorial behavior and enhanced tolerance to close proximity with other filter feeders.

In short, **Skyline Surf Clam ‘Surf-Sky’** is a **rapid-growing, flavor-mild, and space-efficient** cultivar, bringing the versatile culinary qualities of ocean surf clams to urban aquaculture systems with reliable production and consistent quality.
