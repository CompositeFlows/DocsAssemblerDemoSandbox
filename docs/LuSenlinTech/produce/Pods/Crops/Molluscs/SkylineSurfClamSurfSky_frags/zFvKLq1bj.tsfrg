‘Surf-Sky’ is a compact, fast-burrowing strain of Atlantic surf clam (*Spisula solidissima*) engineered for high-density urban aquaculture. This cultivar replicates the classic triangular, streamlined shell of its ocean-dwelling relatives but at a manageable 5-7 cm diameter, perfect for container substrate systems. Selected for its vigorous filtering capacity and rapid growth in artificial seawater, ‘Surf-Sky’ delivers the sweet, mild flavor and tender-yet-firm texture that makes surf clams ideal for both raw and cooked preparations.
