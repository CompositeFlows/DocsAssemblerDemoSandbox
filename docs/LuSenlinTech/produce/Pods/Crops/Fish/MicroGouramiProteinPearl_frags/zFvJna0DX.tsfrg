###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Protein Pearl’ offers an unexpectedly sweet, delicate flavor with a soft, tender texture and very fine flake. The flesh is translucent white and cooks in seconds. The fish itself is a living jewel, displaying iridescent pearl-blue and fiery red-orange vertical stripes in males, and more subdued silver patterning in females. Its small size and labyrinth organ allow it to thrive in shallow, heavily planted systems.

**2. The Delicate, Single-Bite Specialty**
This gourami's tiny size and sweet flavor make it ideal for appetizers, garnishes, and specialized culinary applications where presentation is key.
- **Crispy Fried Whole:** The premier preparation - dusted lightly in starch and deep-fried whole until completely crisp and edible, bones and all, creating a savory, single-bite crunch.
- **Steamed in Leaf Packets:** Several fish can be steamed together in banana or lotus leaf packets with aromatics, resulting in incredibly moist, flavorful morsels.
- **Soup and Broth Garnish:** Added whole to clear broths and delicate soups during the final moments of cooking, where they poach gently and contribute a subtle sweetness.
- **Pickled or Ceviche:** Their small size makes them perfect for quick-pickling or for use in ceviche, where they marinate rapidly.

**3. The Growth & Harvest Cycle**
‘Protein Pearl’ is a rapid-cycle species that breeds readily, allowing for continuous production in a dedicated culture system. Its air-breathing capability makes it exceptionally tolerant of low-oxygen conditions in densely stocked micro-tanks. In a specialized nano-aquaponics setup, a colony provides a **continuous, high-turnover harvest of dozens of fish per 20-liter micro-tank monthly, reaching harvest size of 50g in just 8-10 weeks from hatch.**
