‘Pocket Stripe’ is a dwarf, ornamental-edible strain of channel catfish (*Ictalurus punctatus*) developed for its manageable size, rapid growth, and striking appearance in clear-water balcony systems. This cultivar retains the classic forked tail and deeply forked adipose fin of its larger relatives but displays a pronounced, jet-black lateral stripe against a sleek silver body. Reaching a perfect portion size of 180-250 grams, ‘Pocket Stripe’ delivers the sweet, mild flavor and tender flake of premium channel catfish, without the unpredictable size and occasional off-flavors of wild strains.
