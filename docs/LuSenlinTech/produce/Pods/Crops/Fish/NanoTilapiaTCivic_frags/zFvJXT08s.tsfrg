###### The Science & Story Behind It

The ‘T-Civic’ is a feat of targeted genomics and behavioral selection for a life in controlled aquaculture.
- The dwarfism and rapid maturation are controlled by a carefully managed selection for a specific suite of genes regulating the somatotropic axis (growth hormone/IGF-1), creating a fish that reaches sexual maturity and optimal harvest size quickly, without the indeterminate growth of wild strains.
- The elimination of "off-flavors," often caused by geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) absorbed from algae and bacteria, was achieved by selecting for lines with a reduced ability to accumulate these lipophilic compounds in their tissue, ensuring a clean taste regardless of the system's microbial community.
- Its calm temperament and resilience to handling stress are the result of decades of selective breeding for low cortisol response, which improves overall welfare in high-density environments and prevents the degradation of flesh quality at harvest.

In short, **Nano-Tilapia ‘T-Civic’** is a **clean-flavored, space-optimized, and ethically-engineered** fish, a purpose-built cultivar that transforms the potential of urban aquaculture by delivering a consistent, high-quality protein source from the heart of the city.
