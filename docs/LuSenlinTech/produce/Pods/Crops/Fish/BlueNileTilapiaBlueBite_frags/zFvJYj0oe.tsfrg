‘BlueBite’ is a resilient, cold-tolerant strain of Blue Nile Tilapia (*Oreochromis aureus*) selected for its ability to thrive in the fluctuating temperatures of a balcony aquaponics system. This cultivar displays a distinctive bluish-silver sheen and develops subtle turquoise highlights on its fins and operculum. Bred to maintain robust growth and feeding response in cooler water, ‘BlueBite’ delivers a slightly firmer texture and a more pronounced, sweet flavor than common tilapia, making it a premium choice for cooler climates and seasonal outdoor cultivation.
