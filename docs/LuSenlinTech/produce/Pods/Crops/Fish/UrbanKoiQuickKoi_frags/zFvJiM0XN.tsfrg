###### The Science & Story Behind It

The innovation of ‘Quick-Koi’ lies in its genetically programmed size limitation and stabilized pigmentation for harvest.
- The determinate growth, halting at 180 grams, is controlled by a precisely edited myostatin gene regulator, a "growth brake" that prevents the massive, pond-sized development of traditional koi and directs energy into flavor and texture development instead.
- The intense, stable color patterns are achieved by selecting for specific pigment cell (chromatophore) genetics and ensuring the patterns are fully expressed at the small harvest size, unlike juvenile ornamental koi whose patterns are still developing.
- The rich flavor and firm texture are enhanced by a high-quality, color-enhancing diet and selective breeding for muscle density over the softer flesh often found in slower-growing, ornamental pond specimens.

In short, **Urban Koi ‘Quick-Koi’** is a **visually spectacular, flavor-rich, and size-controlled** cultivar, a fusion of art and science that transforms a legendary ornamental fish into a breathtaking and delicious culinary experience for the urban gourmet.
