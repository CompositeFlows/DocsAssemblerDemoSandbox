###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Edible-3’ offers a clean, mildly sweet flavor with a firm, fine-flake texture and very low oil content. The flesh is bright white and delicate, cooking quickly and evenly. The fish itself is streamlined and muscular, with iridescent golden scales and subtle reddish fin accents, presenting a beautiful whole-fish presentation that requires minimal portioning.

**2. The Perfect Small-Plate Fish**
This barb's small size, elegant appearance, and delicate flavor make it ideal for individual servings and quick-cooking methods.
- **Pan-Fried Whole:** The premier preparation - crisped whole in a pan with oil, allowing the skin to become shatteringly crisp while the flesh stays moist. The small, tender bones become edible when cooked this way.
- **Steamed or Salt-Crusted:** Steaming whole with aromatics preserves its delicate sweetness, while a salt crust creates a dramatic presentation and perfectly seasoned flesh.
- **Ceviche and Escabeche:** Its firm texture holds up excellently in acidic marinades, making it ideal for ceviche or pickled escabeche preparations.
- **Soup and Hot Pot:** Added whole or as filets to broths and hot pots during the final minutes of cooking, where it imparts a light, sweet flavor to the liquid.

**3. The Growth & Harvest Cycle**
‘Edible-3’ is a rapid-growing species that thrives in stable school conditions, showing reduced stress and improved feed conversion when kept in groups. It reaches harvest size quickly, allowing for multiple production cycles per year. In a high-density recirculating system, a school provides a **frequent, staggered harvest, yielding 20-30 fish per 100-liter barrel over a 3-4 month cycle, reaching optimal size of 150g in just 10-12 weeks from juvenile stage.**
