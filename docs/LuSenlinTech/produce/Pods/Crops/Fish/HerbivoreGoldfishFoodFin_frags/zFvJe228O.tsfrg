###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘FoodFin’ offers a surprisingly delicate, sweet flavor with a clean, white flesh and a firm, medium-flake texture. It lacks the strong, earthy notes often associated with bottom-feeding carp species, thanks to its controlled herbivorous diet and suspended feeding habits. The fish has a deep-bodied, athletic form with brassy-gold and olive coloration, bred for muscle mass over flowing fins.

**2. The Mild, Sustainable Whitefish**
This fish's mildness and firm texture make it an excellent "utility" protein, adaptable to various cuisines where it readily absorbs accompanying flavors.
- **Whole Steaming or Baking:** The premier method for smaller fish; steaming with ginger, scallions, and a light soy dressing highlights its natural sweetness and tender flesh.
- **Fish Balls and Cakes:** Its firm, low-fat flesh binds well, making it ideal for creating light, springy fish balls for soups or pan-fried fish cakes.
- **Crispy Fried Whole:** Small fish can be fried whole until the bones are edible and crisp, a popular preparation in many Asian cuisines that minimizes waste.
- **Poached and Flaked:** Gently poached and flaked, it can be used in salads, stuffings, or as a protein topping for grain bowls.

**3. The Growth & Harvest Cycle**
‘FoodFin’ is a highly efficient grazer, thriving on a diet of duckweed, softened vegetables, and high-quality plant-based pellets. Its sterility (triploidy) means all metabolic energy is directed toward growth rather than reproduction. In an integrated aquaponics system, a cohort provides a **steady, sustainable yield of 15-25 fish per 100-liter barrel, reaching optimal harvest size of 250g in 6-8 months, while providing excellent nutrient conversion for plant growth.**
