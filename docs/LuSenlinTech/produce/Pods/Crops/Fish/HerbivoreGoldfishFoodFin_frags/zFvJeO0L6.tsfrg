###### The Science & Story Behind It

The utility of ‘FoodFin’ is a direct result of targeted selection for metabolic efficiency and sterility.
- The triploid sterility is induced, ensuring the fish cannot reproduce and potentially become invasive. This also creates a "metabolic bonus," where all consumed energy is funneled into somatic growth, resulting in faster gain on less feed.
- The mild flavor profile is engineered through a strictly controlled herbivorous diet and selective breeding against the genes associated with geosmin accumulation, effectively eliminating the "muddy" taste common in wild carp species.
- Its robust health and disease resistance are products of selecting for strong immune system markers and a thick, protective mucus coat, making it an incredibly hardy and low-maintenance component of a balanced aquaponic ecosystem.

In short, **Herbivore Goldfish ‘FoodFin’** is a **sterile, efficient, and mild-flavored** cultivar, a purposeful reimagining of a common species into a high-performance, sustainable protein engine for the urban food web.
