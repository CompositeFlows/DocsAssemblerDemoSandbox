###### The Science & Story Behind It

The success of ‘Sun-Dot’ lies in its genetic mastery of compact growth and flavour concentration:
- Its determinate, bushy habit is controlled by a specific expression of the "self-pruning" gene. This gene causes the plant to terminate its own vertical growth naturally, directing all photosynthetic energy into fruit production rather than vines, resulting in a stunningly productive, compact plant.
- The intense, balanced flavour is a product of selecting for a specific volatile organic compound (VOC) profile. ‘Sun-Dot’ has been bred for high levels of geranial (which provides a sweet, floral note) and a favourable sugar-to-acid ratio, ensuring sweetness is complemented by a clean, bright tang, not overwhelming acidity.
- Its exceptionally high fruit-to-foliage ratio is achieved through a modified leaf morphology. The leaves are smaller and more upright, reducing shading and allowing maximum light penetration to the developing fruit trusses, which encourages uniform ripening and superior sugar accumulation.

In short, **Patio Cherry Tomato ‘Sun-Dot’** is a **compact, flavour-bursting, and bountiful** variety, a genetic marvel that packages the prolific yield and perfect taste of a summer tomato into a petite, patio-perfect form.
