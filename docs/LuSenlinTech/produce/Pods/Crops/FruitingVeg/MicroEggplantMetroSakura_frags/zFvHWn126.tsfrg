###### The Science & Story Behind It

The allure of ‘Metro-Sakura’ is a product of targeted breeding for aesthetics, flavour chemistry, and compact form.
- The unique lavender-pink pigmentation is due to a carefully balanced expression of anthocyanins (purple) and a low concentration of chlorophyll in the fruit's skin, a combination rarely found in commercial varieties.
- The complete absence of bitterness is achieved by selecting for plants with minimal synthesis of solasodine glycosides, the compounds responsible for the harsh flavour in under-ripe or certain types of eggplant.
- Its compact, high-yielding habit is governed by a bushy growth gene and a high fruit-set ratio, ensuring the plant's energy is directed into producing its charming, clustered fruits rather than vegetative growth.

In short, **Micro Eggplant ‘Metro-Sakura’** is a **delicate, sweet, and stunningly ornamental** variety, a masterpiece of miniaturization that offers a continuous harvest of beautiful, gourmet fruits from the most compact of spaces.
