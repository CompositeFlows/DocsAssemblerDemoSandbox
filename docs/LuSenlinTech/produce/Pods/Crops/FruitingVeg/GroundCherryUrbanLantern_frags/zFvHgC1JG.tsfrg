‘Urban Lantern’ is a compact, high-yielding cultivar of ground cherry (*Physalis pruinosa*) specifically selected for ornamental value and reliable fruit production in containers. This bushy, well-behaved plant produces a continuous display of delicate, papery husks that resemble miniature Chinese lanterns, hiding within them a golden-orange berry of exceptional tropical sweetness. It is a dual-purpose marvel, serving as a unique, self-harvesting fruit factory and a charming decorative element for the sunny balcony.
