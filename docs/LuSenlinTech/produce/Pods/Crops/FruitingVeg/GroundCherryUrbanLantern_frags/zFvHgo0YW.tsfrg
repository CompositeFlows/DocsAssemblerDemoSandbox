###### The Science & Story Behind It

The appeal of ‘Urban Lantern’ is rooted in its improved plant habit and stabilized flavour chemistry.
- The compact, mounding form is a result of selective breeding for shorter internodes and a more determinate growth pattern than its weedy, sprawling relatives, making it perfectly suited for container life.
- The complex tropical flavour is a specific volatile compound profile, including high levels of methyl anthranilate (imparting a grape-like note) and various lactones that contribute to the pineapple and coconut aromas. Breeding has stabilized this profile for consistency.
- The reliable fruit drop is a key domesticated trait. While all ground cherries abscise when ripe, ‘Urban Lantern’ has been selected for a more synchronized ripening and a stronger stem connection that prevents premature dropping, ensuring the fruits are perfectly ripe when they fall.

In short, **Ground Cherry ‘Urban Lantern’** is a **prolific, self-harvesting, and tropically sweet** fruit, a delightful and low-maintenance specialty crop that brings the joy of foraging and the taste of the tropics to the urban gardener's doorstep.
