###### The Science & Story Behind It

The innovation of ‘Skyline Sugar’ lies in its revolutionary plant architecture and enhanced sugar metabolism.
- The compact, self-supporting columnar form is due to a modified *afila* gene, which converts leaves into tendrils that grip adjacent stems for support, combined with a dwarfing gene that creates short, strong internodes. This creates a dense, interwoven plant that supports its own heavy fruit load.
- The intense sweetness and crispness are a result of selecting for a high concentration of soluble solids (sugars) within the pod walls and a delayed conversion of sugars to starch post-harvest. The pod walls also have a reinforced cellulose structure, providing the signature crunch without fibrousness.
- Its high yield in a small volume is achieved by selecting for a high number of flowering nodes and a shortened juvenile phase, allowing the plant to rapidly transition from vegetative growth to prolific pod production.

In short, **Snap Pea ‘Skyline Sugar’** is a **space-smart, super-sweet, and self-supporting** variety, a genetic masterpiece that condenses the abundant harvest and classic flavour of a pea patch into a sleek, balcony-friendly column.
