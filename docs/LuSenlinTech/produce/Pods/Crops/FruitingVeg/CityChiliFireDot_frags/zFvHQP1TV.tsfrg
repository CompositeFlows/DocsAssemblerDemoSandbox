###### The Science & Story Behind It

The brilliance of ‘FireDot’ lies in its optimized capsaicinoid production and perfect architectural form.
- The plant's extreme compactness and high fruit load are stabilized by a strong, woody micro-stem structure and a modified phytochrome response, allowing it to flower and fruit prolifically even in the dappled light of a dense urban environment.
- The consistent, high heat level is controlled by a specific expression of the Pun1 gene, which regulates the production of capsaicinoids in the placenta of the fruit. ‘FireDot’ has been bred for a stable, "always-on" expression, ensuring reliable pungency in every single pepper, regardless of environmental fluctuations.
- The striking color progression is due to a synchronized and rapid breakdown of chlorophyll and anthocyanins (violet) followed by a swift accumulation of carotenoids (orange to red), creating a plant that always displays a vibrant spectrum of colors.

In short, **City Chili ‘FireDot’** is a **decorative, dense, and deceptively hot** pepper, a masterclass in concentrating both visual appeal and culinary firepower into a beautiful, balcony-sized package.
