‘Pixel-Plum’ is a groundbreaking cultivar that condenses the robust, meaty quality of a classic Roma tomato into a space-saving micro plant. Designed for maximum yield in a minimal footprint, it produces dense clusters of oblong, deep red fruits on a remarkably compact, determinate bush. This tomato is engineered for one purpose: to be the ultimate balcony-grown tomato for creating rich sauces, pastes, and sun-dried tomatoes, all from a plant that fits on a windowsill.
