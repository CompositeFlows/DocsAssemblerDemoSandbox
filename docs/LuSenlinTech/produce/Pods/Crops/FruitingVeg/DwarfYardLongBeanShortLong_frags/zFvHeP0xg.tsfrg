###### The Science & Story Behind It

The achievement of ‘Short-Long’ is a masterclass in altering plant morphology without sacrificing culinary quality.
- The determinate, bushy habit is the result of a powerful dwarfing gene that completely suppresses the vining growth pattern, creating a plant that invests all its energy into a compact framework of productive flowering nodes.
- Despite its shorter pods, the bean retains the classic flavor and texture due to the same unique cell wall structure and sugar profile as its vining relatives. Selection focused on maintaining a high fiber strength-to-tenderness ratio for the perfect cooked texture.
- Its high yield is enabled by a greatly increased number of flowering sites per unit of plant volume and an extended pod-setting period, ensuring a constant harvest from a small, static plant.

In short, **Dwarf Yard-Long Bean ‘Short-Long’** is a **space-defying, earthy-sweet, and abundantly bearing** bean, a genetic innovation that packages the exotic appeal and prolific nature of a vining classic into a tidy, patio-perfect plant.
