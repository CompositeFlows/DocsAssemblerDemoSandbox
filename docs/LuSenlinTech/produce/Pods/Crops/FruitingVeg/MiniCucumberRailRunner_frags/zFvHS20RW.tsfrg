###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Rail-Runner’ delivers the quintessential cucumber experience: a clean, mild, and subtly sweet flavour with zero bitterness. The fruits are slender, 10-12 cm long, with a thin, tender, deep green skin that requires no peeling and a firm, seedless interior that provides an exceptionally crisp and juicy snap. The plant is a controlled, single-main-vine type, ideal for training upwards.

**2. The Quintessential Crunch**
This cucumber’s flawless texture and mildness make it the ultimate fresh-eating variety.
- **Ultimate Snacking Cucumber:** Its small size, thin skin, and seedless interior make it perfect for eating whole and raw, straight from the vine.
- **Salads & Crudité:** Provides a delicate, non-watery crunch to salads and is the ideal size for vegetable platters and lunchboxes.
- **Quick Pickles & Refrigerator Pickles:** Its firm flesh holds up beautifully to quick-pickling in vinegar brines, creating a crisp, refreshing pickle in hours.
- **Chilled Soups & Infused Water:** A top choice for gazpacho or for adding a clean, fresh note to infused waters and cocktails.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
As a gynoecious (all-female flower) variety, ‘Rail-Runner’ sets fruit with immense efficiency and without pollination, ensuring seedless, non-bitter fruits. Harvest daily when fruits are slim and firm to encourage further production. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a **continuous and heavy yield of 2-4 perfectly formed cucumbers per day at peak production, with the first harvest ready approximately 55 days from transplant.**
