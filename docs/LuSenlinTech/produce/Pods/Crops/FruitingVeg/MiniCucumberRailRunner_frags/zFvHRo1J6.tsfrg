‘Rail-Runner’ is a revolutionary, space-efficient gynoecious cucumber bred for vertical production on the urban balcony. This vigorous yet compact vine specializes in producing an uninterrupted cascade of slender, spineless mini-cucumbers, perfect for daily harvesting. Unlike sprawling garden varieties, ‘Rail-Runner’ maximizes yield per vertical inch, transforming a small trellis or railing into a prolific source of crisp, refreshing snacks.
