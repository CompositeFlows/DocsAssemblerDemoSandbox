###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Metro-Sweet’ offers a classic, sugary-sweet bell pepper flavour with zero heat and crisp, juicy flesh. The fruits are small, typically 5-7 cm long, with a thick, succulent wall that provides a satisfying crunch. The plant itself is sturdy and bushy, reaching only 35-40 cm in height, and is remarkably productive, laden with peppers that stand upright above the foliage.

**2. The Ultimate Fresh Snack and Salad Topper**
This pepper’s primary virtue is its flawless performance as a fresh, ready-to-eat vegetable.
- **Garden-Side Snacking:** The perfect size and sweetness for eating whole and raw, straight from the plant. Its thick walls make it incredibly juicy and refreshing.
- **Colorful Crunch in Salads:** Diced or sliced into rings, it adds a brilliant pop of red and a burst of sweet crunch to green salads, grain bowls, and salsas.
- **Stuffed Appetizers:** Its small, blocky shape is ideal for creating single-bite appetizers when stuffed with cheese, grains, or seasoned meats.
- **Skewers and Stir-fries:** Holds its shape and sweet flavour perfectly when briefly grilled on kebabs or quickly tossed into a stir-fry.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Metro-Sweet’ is a prolific, continuous-bearing plant throughout the warm season. Harvest begins with green peppers and continues as they ripen to their full, sweet red stage. Supplied as an RFID-tagged seedling plug, a single plant provides a **steady and generous yield, producing 15-25 thick-walled, mini-peppers over the main season, with fruits ready for harvest approximately 75 days from transplant.**
