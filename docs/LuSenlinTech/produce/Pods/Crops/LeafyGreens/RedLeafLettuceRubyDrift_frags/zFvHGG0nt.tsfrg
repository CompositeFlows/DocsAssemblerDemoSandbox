‘Ruby Drift’ is a visually stunning, loose-leaf lettuce that brings a cascade of deep burgundy and vibrant green to the balcony garden. Bred for both its dramatic colouration and exceptional texture, this cultivar forms beautiful, frilly rosettes that are as soft to the touch as they are to the palate. It offers a perfect balance of mild sweetness and a subtle, nutty essence, providing a long harvest window of exceptionally tender leaves.
