###### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a living lesson in plant pigmentation and genetics:
- The stunning stem colours are due to a mix of betalain pigments - the same pigments that give beets their colour. Magenta stems are rich in betacyanins, while yellow and orange stems contain betaxanthins. These are different from the anthocyanins that colour most other plants and are powerful antioxidants.
- The "Pixel-Stem" name refers to the plant's genetic heterogeneity. Unlike a uniform crop, this mix is deliberately bred to express a wide range of colour genes in every planting, creating a living mosaic where no two plants are exactly alike.
- Swiss chard is a member of the *Amaranthaceae* family, the same as beets and quinoa, but has been selected for leaf and stem production rather than a large root. Its tolerance for both cool and warm weather makes it one of the most resilient and long-lasting greens for a balcony garden.

In short, **Rainbow Swiss Chard ‘Pixel-Stem’** is an **edible artist's palette**, a continuously producing plant that delivers a spectacular harvest of colourful, crisp stems and tender, earthy leaves, turning every meal into a vibrant and nutritious work of art.
