###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘HeatGuard’ offers the quintessential spinach profile: a sweet, mildly earthy flavour with the distinct, clean mineral note that defines this beloved green. Its leaves are dark green, succulent, and spoon-shaped, growing on an upright, open rosette that remains tender and vegetative long after other varieties have bolted.

**2. The Quintessential Versatile Green**
This spinach’s classic flavour and reliable texture make it a foundational ingredient.
- **Fresh Salads:** Young, tender leaves are perfect for fresh salads, providing a sweet, nutritious base.
- **Creamed & Sautéed:** The ultimate green for wilting. It performs beautifully in creamed spinach, sautés with garlic, and as a filling for quiches and pastries, where its sweetness is enhanced.
- **Smoothies & Juices:** A top choice for green smoothies and juices, adding a massive nutrient boost with its mild, sweet flavour that blends well with fruits.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
The plant is a cut-and-come-again variety. For a continuous harvest, carefully pick the larger outer leaves at the base, allowing the central crown to produce new growth. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **reliable and extended yield of 30–50g of tender leaves per week, often lasting 2-3 weeks longer than standard varieties before bolting.**
