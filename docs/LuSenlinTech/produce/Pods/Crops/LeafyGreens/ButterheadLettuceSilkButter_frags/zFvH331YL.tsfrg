###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Silk-Butter’ lives up to its name, offering a remarkably delicate, sweet, and clean flavour with none of the bitterness found in some other lettuces. Its texture is its hallmark - incredibly soft, supple, and almost silky. The leaves are thin, flexible, and a vibrant, light green, forming a beautiful loose head.

**2. The Delicate Salad Base**
This lettuce is best used in applications where its delicate texture can shine without being overpowered.
- **The Classic Tender Salad:** The perfect base for delicate, lightly dressed salads where its texture is the star. It pairs exquisitely with soft herbs, edible flowers, and subtle vinaigrettes.
- **Gourmet Wraps & Cups:** Its large, pliable leaves are ideal for using as soft wraps for delicate fillings like chicken salad, quinoa, or roasted vegetables, serving as an edible, elegant container.
- **Luxury Garnish:** A perfect bed for showcasing beautifully plated seafood, terrines, or appetizers, adding a touch of refined colour and texture without competing in flavour.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
The plant forms a loose, open head. For the best quality, it is typically harvested as a full head by cutting at the base, but outer leaves can be picked for a extended, though less prolific, harvest. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **yield of one delicate, 120–150g head approximately 40 days from planting.**
