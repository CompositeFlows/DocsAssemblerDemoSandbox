###### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a study in cellular structure and leaf morphology:
- The signature "buttery" texture is a result of a very thin leaf epidermis (skin) and a high water content held within large, thin-walled cells. These cells rupture with minimal pressure, creating that melting sensation, unlike the rigid, crunchy cells of romaine or iceberg.
- Its sweet flavour and lack of bitterness are linked to a low concentration of sesquiterpene lactones, the compounds responsible for the sharp, bitter notes in many wild and cultivated greens like endive and escarole.
- The loose, open head form is a natural adaptation for preventing moisture and rot in the heart of the plant, a trait that has been selectively maintained and enhanced to create this specific, desirable texture and appearance.

In short, **Butterhead Lettuce ‘Silk-Butter’** is a **leaf of pure delicacy**, a cultivar that prioritizes a sublime, melting texture and a gentle sweetness, offering a truly luxurious salad experience from a surprisingly easy-to-grow plant.
