This charming, free-floating aquatic plant is the pond's miniature water lily, a dwarf cultivar prized for its elegant form and surprising culinary potential. ‘Tiny Shield’ creates a carpet of perfect, coin-sized leaves on the water's surface, offering a delicate, crisp texture and a clean, aquatic flavour.
