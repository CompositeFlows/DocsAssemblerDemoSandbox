##### The Science & Story Behind It

This tiny plant is a fascinating example of rapid adaptation and botanical efficiency:
- Frogbit is a "neotenic" plant, meaning it retains its juvenile, floating form throughout its life and rarely flowers in cultivation, dedicating all its energy to vegetative reproduction.
- Its leaves are covered in a superhydrophobic (water-repelling) wax coating, causing water to bead up and roll off perfectly. This natural nanotechnology, known as the "lotus effect," keeps the harvestable parts perfectly dry and clean.
- While its wild relatives can become invasive in some waterways, ‘Tiny Shield’ is a sterile, patented cultivar specifically bred for controlled environments, ensuring its prolific growth benefits your ecosystem without any ecological risk.

In short, **Frogbit ‘Tiny Shield’** is a **self-cleaning aquatic garnish**, a prolific producer of elegant, crisp foliage that brings a touch of pristine pond-side freshness and a delightful crunch to your most refined dishes.
