##### The Science & Story Behind It

Sea lettuce is a fascinating and resilient organism:
- It is a type of green algae that can be found in coastal waters worldwide, a testament to its adaptability. The 'Urban Ulva' strain has been selected for its particularly mild flavour and rapid growth in controlled conditions.
- It is an "indicator species;" large blooms in the wild can signal nutrient pollution (eutrophication). In your controlled system, it instead acts as a nutrient scrubber, helping to maintain clean water.
- It is rich in dietary fibre, iron, and vitamin C, which can enhance the absorption of its plant-based iron.

In short, **Sea Lettuce ‘Urban Ulva’** is the **gateway sea vegetable**, a mild-mannered and versatile algae that effortlessly brings the fresh, healthy taste of the sea to your everyday cooking.
