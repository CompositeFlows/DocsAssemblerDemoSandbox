##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
It has a clean, mild salinity with a refreshing, slightly sweet finish and a tender, almost melt-in-your-mouth texture when fresh. Its vibrant green colour brightens any dish.

###### 2. The Salad of the Sea
Its mildness makes it incredibly versatile.
- **Fresh Salads:** The star ingredient in fresh seaweed salads, often paired with a sesame-soy dressing. It can be mixed with terrestrial greens for a flavourful twist.
- **Broths & Soups:** Adds a subtle ocean flavour to miso soup, fish stews, and chowders without overpowering other ingredients.
- **Wrap & Garnish:** Can be used as a novel, edible wrap for rice, fish, or vegetable fillings, or simply torn as a garnish.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
It grows in thin, leafy sheets on the HydraPad™. Harvesting involves cutting the desired amount of fresh material. A single pad provides a **continuous yield of 50–70g of fresh sea lettuce weekly.**
