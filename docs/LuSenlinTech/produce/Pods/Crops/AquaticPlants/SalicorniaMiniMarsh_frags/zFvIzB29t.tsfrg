##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
It is intensely crisp and juicy, with a bright, clean salinity that evokes the ocean breeze. Its flavour is a direct, refreshing saltiness, often with a subtle, earthy undertone. The stems are tender yet satisfyingly snappy, with no tough fibres.

###### 2. The Ocean's Crunch
This plant is celebrated for its unique texture and built-in seasoning.
- **The Ultimate Garnish:** A premier garnish for seafood - especially oysters, grilled fish, and scallops - where its salty crunch complements the delicate brininess of the ocean.
- **Salads & Pickles:** Adds a spectacular textural and flavourful element to fresh salads. It can be quickly pickled in vinegar to balance its saltiness, creating a sophisticated condiment.
- **Sautéed Side Dish:** Briefly sautéed in a touch of butter or oil, it wilts slightly, becoming a luxurious, stand-alone side dish that requires no added salt.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant grows in upright, branching stems. Harvesting involves snipping the tender upper portions of the stems. A single HydraPad™ provides a **continuous yield of 60–80g of pristine stems every 3-4 weeks**, allowing for multiple harvests from the same plant.
