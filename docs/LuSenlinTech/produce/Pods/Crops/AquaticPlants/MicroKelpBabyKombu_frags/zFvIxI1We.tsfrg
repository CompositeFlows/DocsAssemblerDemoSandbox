##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Baby Kombu’ offers a robust, savoury-sweet flavour, packed with deep umami. It is softer and more tender than traditional kombu, but still possesses a satisfying, slightly firm texture that holds up beautifully in cooking. A white, crystalline dust of natural glutamates often coats its surface - the visual promise of its flavour power.

###### 2. The Foundation of Flavour
This kelp is the secret weapon for building depth in a vast array of dishes.
- **The Ultimate Broth:** A single 5cm piece is enough to create a rich, clear dashi broth, the fundamental base for miso soup, noodle dishes, and sauces. It is always gently simmered, never boiled, to extract its sweetness without bitterness.
- **Savory Stews & Braises:** Add a piece to bean stews, pot roasts, or braised vegetables. It tenderizes fibres and imparts a rich, savoury background note that enhances other ingredients.
- **Seasoning & Condiments:** After making broth, the rehydrated kelp can be finely sliced and marinated into a delicious tsukudani (a sweet-savoury simmered condiment) or dried and ground into a potent umami salt.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The kelp grows as a single, strap-like blade from a central holdfast on the HydraPad™. Mature blades are harvested by cutting at the base. A single pad provides a **sustained yield of 2-3 blades, each 15-20cm long, ready for harvest every 4-5 weeks.**
