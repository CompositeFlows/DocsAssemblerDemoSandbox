##### The Science & Story Behind It

‘Metro-Ogo’ is a cultivar with deep cultural roots and unique biological traits:
- It is a primary source for agar, a gelatinous substance used worldwide as a vegetarian alternative to gelatin. However, ‘Metro-Ogo’ is cultivated from a strain selected for low agar content, prioritizing its culinary crunch over its gelling properties.
- In Hawaii, wild *Gracilaria* is known as *ogo* and has been foraged from tidal pools for generations, forming a foundational element of the islands' local food culture.
- Its brilliant red colour comes from phycoerythrin, a pigment that helps the algae absorb blue-green light in deeper water. This pigment is also a powerful antioxidant.

In short, **Red Ogo ‘Metro-Ogo’** is a **cultured crunch from the coral reef**, a textural and cultural icon that delivers the authentic taste and satisfying snap of a Hawaiian shore directly to your urban kitchen.
