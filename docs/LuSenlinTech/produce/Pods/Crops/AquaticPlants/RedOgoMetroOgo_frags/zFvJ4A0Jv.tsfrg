##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
It offers a firm, snappy, almost cartilaginous crunch that is uniquely satisfying. Its flavour is a well-balanced blend of fresh ocean brine with a distinct, sweet finish. The branches are deep red, translucent, and form beautiful, intricate clumps that add visual drama to any dish.

###### 2. The Crunch of the Coast
This seaweed is a textural superstar, essential for specific culinary applications.
- **The Poke Bowl Essential:** A non-negotiable ingredient in authentic Hawaiian poke, providing a crucial crunchy contrast to the soft, marinated cubes of raw fish and creamy avocado.
- **Advanced Salads:** Shines in seaweed salads, either on its own or mixed with other sea vegetables like sea lettuce. Its robust texture holds up well to bold, citrus-based dressings.
- **Sushi & Seafood Garnish:** Used as a bed for sashimi or a garnish for grilled fish, adding both a splash of colour and a burst of oceanic crunch.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The algae grows in dense, bushy clumps on the HydraPad™. Harvesting involves trimming the bushiest branches from the main clump, which encourages further branching. A single pad provides a **continuous yield of 40–60g of crisp, ready-to-eat seaweed every 2-3 weeks.**
