###### The Science & Story Behind It

The brilliance of ‘Neon 5’ lies in its stabilized colour genetics and optimized root morphology for containers.
- The consistent, multi-coloured expression is achieved by interbreeding stabilized monochromatic lines and selecting for plants where the colour traits are linked, ensuring each seed has an equal chance to express one of the five distinct hues. The purple colour comes from anthocyanins, the red from lycopene, the yellow from xanthophylls, and the white from a lack of pigments.
- Its slender, stump-rooted form and absence of a woody core are classic Nantes traits, but ‘Neon 5’ has been further selected for a shortened taproot and enhanced lateral root growth, allowing it to form a perfect, miniature root in the shallow depth of a soil pod.
- The rapid maturity and uniform growth are a result of selecting for highly efficient photosynthesis in the lacy foliage and a swift transition from vegetative growth to root bulking, ensuring all carrots in a bunch mature at the same time despite their colour differences.

In short, **Finger Carrot ‘Neon 5’** is a **fast-maturing, colourful, and container-optimized** root vegetable, a genetic artist’s palette that delivers a harvest of sweet, crunchy, and stunningly beautiful carrots for the urban gourmet.
