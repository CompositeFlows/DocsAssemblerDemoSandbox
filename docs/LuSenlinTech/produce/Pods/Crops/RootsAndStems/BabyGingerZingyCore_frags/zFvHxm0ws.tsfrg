###### The Science & Story Behind It

The distinct qualities of ‘Zingy Core’ stem from its accelerated development and selected phytochemical profile.
- The compact growth and rapid bulking are achieved by selecting for a high tillering (shoot-producing) capacity and an efficient photoperiod response that triggers early rhizome initiation in the warm, confined environment of a container.
- Its complex, floral-spicy flavor with reduced harshness is due to a unique balance of volatile oils - higher in citral (lemony) and geraniol (floral), with moderated levels of the more pungent shogaols typically found in mature ginger.
- The tender, low-fiber texture results from a delayed lignification process in the rhizome's cell walls, extending the harvest window for succulent, non-stringy ginger that melts effortlessly when grated.

In short, **Baby Ginger ‘Zingy Core’** is a **fast-maturing, tender, and flavor-packed** rhizome, a gourmet cultivar that brings the bright, fresh essence of young ginger within practical reach of the balcony gardener.
