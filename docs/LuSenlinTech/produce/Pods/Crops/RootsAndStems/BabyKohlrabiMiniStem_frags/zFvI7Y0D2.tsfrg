###### The Science & Story Behind It

The excellence of ‘Mini Stem’ stems from its controlled swelling genetics and optimized flavor development for rapid growth.
- The perfectly spherical, compact bulb formation is achieved through selective breeding for uniform cell expansion in the hypocotyl (stem) region, creating a symmetrical shape ideal for container growing and consistent cooking times.
- Its sweet, non-woody texture results from a delayed lignification process in the bulb tissues and a high water content maintained throughout development, ensuring tender crispness even at full maturity.
- The rapid maturity and uniform growth are enabled by highly efficient photosynthesis in the upright leaves and a swift transition from vegetative growth to bulb swelling, allowing all plants in a crop to mature simultaneously.

In short, **Baby Kohlrabi ‘Mini Stem’** is a **fast-maturing, sweet, and space-efficient** stem vegetable, a specialized cultivar that offers the perfect combination of ornamental appeal, reliable production, and gourmet quality for the urban gardener.
