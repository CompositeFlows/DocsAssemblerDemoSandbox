###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Flash-40’ offers a classic radish profile: a sharp, clean peppery kick that is assertive without being harsh, followed by a refreshing, crisp finish. The roots are uniformly round, about 2.5-3 cm in diameter, with a vibrant red skin and a solid, dense white interior that resists forming hollow centers. The greens are edible but slightly prickly, best used when very young.

**2. The Quintessential Crisp Crunch**
This radish's speed and reliable texture make it a staple for adding a pungent crunch to a wide array of dishes.
- **Salads and Slaws:** Sliced or grated, it provides a sharp, peppery counterpoint to sweet and rich ingredients in green salads and creamy slaws.
- **Fresh Garnish:** A few thin slices on top of soups, tacos, or avocado toast instantly elevates the dish with colour and a clean, sharp bite.
- **Quick-Pickled:** Its firm flesh holds up perfectly to quick-pickling in a sweet or spicy brine, creating a crisp, tangy condiment in just hours.
- **Buttered Radish:** A classic French snack; served whole with just a sprinkle of salt and a swipe of high-quality butter to balance the pepperiness.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Flash-40’ is the epitome of a rapid-cycle crop. It is best harvested promptly once the roots reach their full size and colour; leaving them in the ground longer does not significantly increase size but can risk pithiness. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a **dense and synchronized yield of 10-15 uniform roots, ready for a single, swift harvest in an incredibly fast 38-42 days from sowing.**

###### The Science & Story Behind It

The performance of ‘Flash-40’ is driven by its accelerated metabolism and robust cellular structure.
- Its unparalleled speed is a result of a drastically shortened juvenile phase and highly efficient photosynthetic allocation to the root. The plant transitions from leaf production to root bulking almost immediately, a trait selected for successive generations.
- The resistance to pithiness (the formation of hollow, spongy centers) is a key breakthrough. This is achieved by selecting for plants with delayed root lignification and more uniform cell division throughout the root's cortex, ensuring the interior remains dense and crisp even if harvest is slightly delayed.
- Its bolt resistance is linked to a dampened response to photoperiod and temperature fluctuations, the primary triggers for flowering in radishes. This allows ‘Flash-40’ to maintain its focus on root development during the variable conditions of a balcony microclimate.

In short, **Radish ‘Flash-40’** is a **blisteringly fast, crisp, and bolt-resistant** variety, a genetic sprinter that guarantees a rapid, reliable, and pungent harvest for the impatient urban gardener.
