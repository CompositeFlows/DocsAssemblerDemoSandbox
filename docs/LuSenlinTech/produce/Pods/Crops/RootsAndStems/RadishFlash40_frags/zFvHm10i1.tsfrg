‘Flash-40’ is an ultra-rapid, stress-tolerant radish bred for the fastest possible turnaround in balcony gardening. This cultivar lives up to its name, producing perfectly round, brilliant scarlet radishes with a crisp, snowy-white interior in as little as 40 days from sowing. Engineered to resist pithiness and bolting even through fluctuations in water and temperature, ‘Flash-40’ delivers a consistent, sharp, and clean peppery bite, making it the most reliable radish for successive sowing and non-stop harvests.
