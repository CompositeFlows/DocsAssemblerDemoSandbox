###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Taro-Tiny’ offers the classic, comforting flavor of taro: a nutty, earthy sweetness with hints of vanilla and a texture that becomes soft and fluffy when cooked. The corms are small, rounded, and typically 5-8 cm in diameter, with distinctive concentric rings and pale flesh that may have lavender specks. The plant forms an attractive, compact cluster of upright, heart-shaped leaves on slender petioles, with some varieties showing dark purple veining or margins.

**2. The Dual-Purpose Tropical Staple**
This taro’s compact nature makes both its roots and leaves accessible for various traditional and modern culinary applications.
- **Poached or Steamed Corms:** The preferred method to enjoy its natural nutty flavor; once cooked, it can be mashed, sliced, or used as a potato alternative.
- **Taro Chips and Fries:** Sliced thinly and fried or baked for a sweet, earthy snack with a beautiful pale lavender hue.
- **Taro Desserts and Paste:** The key ingredient for traditional desserts like taro mochi, bubble tea, and sweet taro paste, where its color and flavor shine.
- **Cooked Young Leaves (*Laing*):** The young, tender leaves must be cooked thoroughly to remove calcium oxalate crystals and can be used in traditional Filipino dishes like *laing* (taro leaves in coconut milk).

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Taro-Tiny’ matures in one growing season, signaling readiness when the leaves begin to yellow in early autumn. The entire plant can be lifted from the container to reveal a cluster of small corms around a central mother corm. Supplied as an RFID-tagged starter tuber, a single plant provides a **modest but valuable yield of 4-7 small, rounded corms totaling 300-500g, plus the bonus of ornamental, edible leaves throughout the season.**
