###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Ruby 2’ offers a remarkably sweet, earthy flavour with subtle nutty undertones and very low geosmin content, the compound responsible for strong earthy notes. The roots are perfectly round, smooth-skinned, and intensely ruby-red throughout, with no internal zoning or woodiness. The greens are tender, glossy, and have a flavour similar to Swiss chard, but more delicate and less pungent.

**2. The Dual-Harvest Gourmet**
This beet’s value is in its complete usability, providing two distinct, high-quality crops from a single plant.
- **Whole Roasted or Glazed:** Their small size allows them to be roasted or steamed whole, becoming meltingly tender and intensely sweet, perfect for salads or as a glazed side dish.
- **Pickled and Preserved:** The classic use for baby beets, creating vibrant, sweet-and-sour pickles that retain their firm texture and beautiful colour.
- **Fresh Greens Sauté:** The young leaves and stems can be harvested continuously and sautéed with garlic as a nutrient-dense side, or used raw in salads when very young.
- **Vibrant Purees and Hummus:** Creates the most brilliantly coloured, sweet purees, soups, and vibrant pink hummus.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Ruby 2’ is a fast-maturing, determinate-type beet. For a dual harvest, young greens can be carefully picked without harming the developing root. The primary root harvest occurs when they reach 3-4 cm in diameter. Supplied as an RFID seed tape, a single planting provides a **dense and uniform yield of 5-8 perfectly formed baby beets and a substantial bunch of greens, with roots ready for harvest in just 45-50 days from sowing.**
