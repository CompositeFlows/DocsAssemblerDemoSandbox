##### Frame Module Options

Choose between two module configurations for your Frame Tower, each designed to optimise your growing experience based on your space and crop preferences.

- ###### Solo Module

   A single 1000mm long module offers a spacious, unified growing area for streamlined cultivation. Ideal for focusing on one crop type, such as herbs or leafy greens, in a compact setup.

- ###### Twin Modules

   Two 500mm long modules provide independent growing spaces for diverse cultivation. Perfect for combining crops like microgreens and small fish, enhancing flexibility in a single frame.
