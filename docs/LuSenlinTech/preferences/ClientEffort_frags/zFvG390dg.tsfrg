###### PureLight™:

- An advanced material engineered at the nanoscale to manipulate heat and light.
- Transmits 95% of light of glass whilst providing superior insulation (~0.002–0.005 W/m·K).
- Features an anti-condensation surface that prevents droplet formation, ensuring maximum light penetration and reducing fungal risk.
- Lightweight, durable, maximizes photosynthesis by maintaining stable temperatures for year-round crop growth.
- Integrated Spectral Tuning: (Optional) Micro-thin organic phosphor layers that can be electrically tuned to shift the light spectrum, enhancing specific plant growth phases (e.g., more blue for vegetation, more red for fruiting) in coordination with the nanoSunBeam™ LEDs.
- Self-Diagnostic Layer: (Optional) An embedded transparent conductive oxide grid that can monitor panel integrity and light transmission uniformity, reporting performance data directly to the harvestSage™ AI.
